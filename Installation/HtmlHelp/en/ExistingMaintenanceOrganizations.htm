<p>You can add an existing organization to your list of maintenance organizations by clicking <span class="CButton">Add Existing Organization</span> in the Maintenance Organization window (see <a href="Browse.Organization.htm">Your Maintenance Organization List</a>). MainBoss opens a window where you can specify database information:</p>

<p class="box">The person who originally created the database should tell you what values to enter in "<span class="CField">Database Server</span>" and "<span class="CField">Database Name</span>" below.</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Database Server</span>: The network location of the SQL Server through which you will access the database. For more information, see the Installation and Administration Guide.

<br /><br />If you click the accompanying "..." button, MainBoss displays a list of database servers that are known to your Windows system. There may be additional servers that you can use but that Windows doesn't currently know about. For more, see <a href="Browse.SQL%20Server.htm">The Database Server List</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Database Name</span>: The name of the database, as known to the SQL Server. The name must be the name given to the database when it was created. If you click the accompanying "..." button, MainBoss displays the names of all MainBoss databases managed by the specified "<span class="CField">Database Server</span>". (For more, see <a href="Browse.SQL%20Database.htm">The Database Name List</a>.)</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Organization Name</span>: A name that you personally will use for this database. By default, this will be the organization name that was specified by whoever created the database. You may, however, change "<span class="CField">Organization Name</span>" to any other value for your own convenience. Changing your own version of "<span class="CField">Organization Name</span>" will not affect anyone else who uses the database.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Make browsers smaller by not showing details for selected record by default</span>: If you checkmark this box, MainBoss will automatically hide the details panel when displaying table viewers in this database. For more, see <a href="HidingtheDetailsforaSelectedRecord.htm">Hiding the Details for a Selected Record</a>. Note that you can still ask MainBoss to display the details panel for a particular table by pressing the button for displaying details.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Preferred Mode</span>: The default mode in which this database should be opened. If you do not specify a mode explicitly, the database will be opened in the given mode. For more on modes, see <a href="Browse.Organization.htm">Your Maintenance Organization List</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">OK</span>: Adds the specified database to your list. MainBoss attempts to access the specified database and add it to your list of known databases.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without adding any database.</p>
