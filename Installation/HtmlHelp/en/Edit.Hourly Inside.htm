<p>You create or modify hourly inside records using the hourly inside editor. The usual way to open the editor is to click <span class="CButton">New Hourly Inside</span> or <span class="CButton">Edit</span> in the <span class="CButton">View</span> section of <span class="CPanel">Coding Definitions</span> | <span class="CPanel">Work Orders</span> | <span class="CPanel">Labor</span> | <span class="CPanel">Hourly Inside</span>.</p>

<p>The hourly inside editor window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Details</span> section: Basically details about the record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Code</span>: A brief code to identify this record. No two records may have the same code.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Description</span>: A longer description of the record (employee and trade).</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Employee</span>: A record in the employees table specifying an employee to associate with this hourly inside record. You must create the employee record before you can fill in this field. For more on contacts, see <a href="Employees.htm">Employees</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Trade</span>: A trade to associate with this type of work. You must create the trade record before you can fill in this field. For more on trades, see <a href="Trades.htm">Trades</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Cost</span>: The hourly rate paid for the work.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Cost Center</span>: The cost center to be used in connection with this labor expense. For more on cost centers, see <a href="CostCenters.htm">Cost Centers</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Comments</span>: Any comments you want to associate with the hourly inside rate.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Task Demand Hourly Inside</span> section: Lists tasks that include a demand that involves this hourly inside record. For more information, see <a href="Tasks.htm">Tasks</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
