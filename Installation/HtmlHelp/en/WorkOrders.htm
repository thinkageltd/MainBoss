<p>When you <span class="NewTerm">open</span> a work order, you create a new work order to deal with corrective maintenance.</p>

<ul class="b1"><li>Work orders can be based on existing work requests. If so, MainBoss copies information from the work request into the new work order so you don't have to type everything again.</li>
<li>Work orders can also be created on their own, without a previous work request.
</li></ul><p>While creating a work order, you often estimate the labor and materials that will be required for the job. You also provide information for the people who will do the work: a description of the problem, how to obtain access to the work area, and so on. When all the relevant information has been entered, you typically print off the work order and hand it to the personnel who have been assigned to the job.</p>

<p class="box">Labor and materials are called the <span class="NewTerm">resources</span> of a work order. Resource estimates made for a job are called <span class="NewTerm">demands</span>.</p>

<p>When you <span class="NewTerm">close</span> a work order, you indicate that the work has been finished. Typically, you also fill in details of the job: how much time was actually taken (as opposed to the initial estimates), what materials were actually used, and so on.</p>
