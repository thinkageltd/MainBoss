<p>You view work orders with <span class="CPanel">Work Orders</span>. The window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">View</span> section: Shows all work orders.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Number</span>: Click this heading to sort the list by work order number. Click again to reverse the order (from ascending to descending or vice versa).</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Priority</span>: Click this heading to sort the list by priority. Click again to reverse the order.</p>
<p class="box">Work orders with explicit priorities are considered more urgent than ones where the priority field is blank. Therefore, if you sort your work orders by priority, those with no explicit priority will come last.</p>

<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Current State History Status</span>: Click this heading to sort the list by current status. Click again to reverse the order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Subject</span>: Click this heading to sort the list by subject. Click again to reverse the order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Apply Filter</span>: Lets you set up a <span class="NewTerm">filter</span> to select which records should be shown in the table. For more information, see <a href="Filter.htm">Table Filters</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Details</span> section: Shows basic information from the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Assignments</span> section: Shows people assigned to the selected work order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Service Contracts</span> section: Lists any service contracts associated with the unit in the selected work order. For more on service contracts, see <a href="ServiceContracts.htm">Service Contracts</a>. For more on units, see <a href="Units.htm">Units</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Resources</span> section: Lists any labor and materials associated with the selected work order. For more on resources, see <a href="Resources.htm">Resources</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Temporary Storage</span> section: Lists any temporary storage locations associated with the selected work order, as well as the contents of those locations. For more on temporary storage, see <a href="Edit.Temporary Storage.htm">Temporary Storage Locations</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Meters</span> section: Lists any meters in the unit of the selected work order. For more on meters, see <a href="Meters.htm">Meters</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Purchase Orders</span> section: Lists any purchase orders associated with the selected work order. For more on purchase orders, see <a href="PurchaseOrders.htm">Purchase Orders</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Chargebacks</span> section: Lists any chargebacks associated with the selected work order. For more on chargebacks, see <a href="Chargebacks.htm">Chargebacks</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Requests</span> section: Lists any requests associated with the selected work order. For more on requests, see <a href="Requests.htm">Requests</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">State History</span> section: Lists records that show when the selected work order changed state. For more on work order state history, see <a href="Edit.Work Order State History.htm">Editing Work Order State History Records</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">New Work Order</span>: Opens a window to create a new work order. Fields in the new record will either be blank or assigned default values (as specified in the <span class="CButton">Defaults for Work Orders</span> section).</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">New Work Order From Task</span>: Opens a window where you can create a new work order that uses a task as a template (often called boilerplate work orders). For example, suppose you have a task that describes what should be done when changing a muffler. When the time comes to change the muffler on a particular car, you can use <span class="CButton">New Work Order From Task</span>. For more, see <a href="Edit.Work Order From Task.htm">Work Orders Created from Tasks</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">New Task From Work order</span>: Opens a window where you can create a new task based on information from a selected work order. For example, the new task record will start off with the same subject line as the original work order, the same work description and so on. You then have the option of editing these fields before you make the final task record. For more, see <a href="Edit.Task From Work Order.htm">Tasks Created from Work Orders</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Edit.png" alt="Edit" /></span>: This drop-down button offers several possible actions:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Edit</span>: Opens an editor window to let you edit the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">View</span>: Opens an editor window where you can examine the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="PrintHS.png" alt="Print" /></span>: Opens a window where you can print some or all of your work orders. For more information, see <a href="Report.Work Order.htm">Printing Work Orders</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2">State change actions: A drop-down button which offers a list of actions that can be used to change the state of the work order. The current state of the work order determines which actions are enabled; it also determines which action is displayed as the label for the button. The available options are:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Open</span>: Changes a draft work order into an open one. Opening a work order suggests that the work order contains all the information you need before starting the job and is ready to be issued to workers.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Open Work Order (With Comment)</span>: Same as <span class="CButton">Open</span>, except that MainBoss will also open a window where you can record a comment about what you're doing.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Close Work Order</span>: Changes an open work order into a closed one. Closing a work order suggests that the job is finished and you have recorded all relevant information about the work.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Close Work Order (With Comment)</span>: Same as <span class="CButton">Close Work Order</span>, except that MainBoss will also open a window where you can record a comment about what you're doing.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Reopen</span>: Changes a closed work order back into an open one. You might do this if you need to correct some information on the work order. MainBoss opens a window where you may record a comment explaining why you're reopening the work order.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Suspend</span>: Changes an open work order into a draft one. You might do this if you find that you need to make significant changes to the work order. MainBoss opens a window where you may record a comment explaining why you're suspending the work order.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Void</span>: Changes a draft work order into a void one. This means canceling the job. MainBoss opens a window where you may record a comment explaining why you're canceling the work order.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Re-Draft</span>: Changes a void work order into a draft one. This means reactivating a canceled job. MainBoss opens a window where you may record a comment explaining why you're reactivating the work order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span>: Lets you search through the list of records for a particular record. For more information, see <a href="Search.htm">Searching for a Particular Record</a>. The <span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span> button has an accompanying drop-down list containing the following:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Find Next</span>: Uses the same search condition(s) as your most recent search and finds the next record in the table that matches the condition(s). If the search reaches the end of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the start of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Find Previous</span>: Same as <span class="CButton">Find Next</span> except that it goes backward in the table. If the search reaches the start of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the end of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Add Work Order Comment</span>: Adds a comment to the selected work order. The comment is recorded in a state history record. For more, see <a href="Edit.Work Order State History.htm">Editing Work Order State History Records</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Defaults for Work Orders</span> section: Shows any defaults to be used when creating new work orders.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Details</span> section: Defaults for basic work order information, including the format for work order numbers.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Printed Form</span> section: Defaults to be used when printing a work order. For more on printing work orders, see <a href="Report.Work Order.htm">Printing Work Orders</a>.</p>
<p class="box"><span class="CInset">Note:</span> If you change the text in the <span class="CButton">Printed Form</span> section, it does <span class="Emphasis">not</span> change the text in any customizations you have saved previously. Customizations save their own copies of the <span class="CButton">Printed Form</span> information, and these copies are independent of any changes you make later in the main defaults. This can be confusing&#8212;when you use a customization, you will not see your new text, but rather the old text that was active when the customization was saved.</p>

<p class="wi3"><span class="CField">Additional Labor/Material Lines</span>: Specifies a number. MainBoss will leave that number of blank lines in the work order, so that workers have space to write in notes about labor and/or materials. For example, workers might use this area to write in a list of materials that weren't included in the original work order but were unexpectedly needed on the job.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CField">Additional Information</span>: Specifies additional text to be added to each printed work order (in addition to the standard information that MainBoss puts in). For example, this text might include a signature line so that workers can have customers sign off when a job is completed.</p>
<p class="box"><span class="CInset">Note:</span> Due to limitations in Microsoft software, blank lines at the end of "<span class="CField">Additional Information</span>" will be deleted whenever work orders are printed. If you want some extra blank space at the end of the "<span class="CField">Additional Information</span>" area, put a single character at the beginning of one or more lines; for example, a single underscore character ( _ ) will keep the lines from being deleted while still giving you plenty of blank space.</p>

<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Edit Defaults</span>: Opens a window to let you change the displayed default values.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
<p>The general work order viewer shows <span class="Emphasis">all</span> of your work orders. In many cases, you may prefer to use one of the viewers that are restricted to certain types of work orders:</p>
