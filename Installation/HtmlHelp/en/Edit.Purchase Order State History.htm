<p>A purchase order may be in a number of states: draft, issued, closed, and void. Whenever a purchase order changes state, MainBoss opens a window where you can record comments and set the effective date of what happened. For example, when you close a purchase order, MainBoss opens a window where you can specify a date that the PO was closed and record any relevant comments. You can also create a state history record by clicking <span class="CButton">Add Purchase Order Comment</span> in any window where the button appears.</p>

<p>The window that records state information contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Number</span>: A read-only field identifying the purchase order whose state is changing.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Current State History State</span>: A read-only field telling the current state of the purchase order (before the state changes).</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Current State History Status</span>: A read-only field giving the current status of the purchase order. For more on purchase order statuses, see <a href="PurchaseOrderStatusCodes.htm">Purchase Order Status Codes</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Effective Date</span>: The date/time when the state changed. By default, MainBoss fills this in with the current date/time. (Note that MainBoss also records the <span class="Emphasis">actual</span> date/time on which the state changed&#8212;i.e. the date when you're actually filling out this record.)</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">User Contact</span>: A read-only field identifying the person who created this record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">State</span>: A read-only field identifying the new state of the purchase order (the state the purchase order will enter once you <span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span> this record).</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Status</span>: A new status code that you want to assign to this purchase order. Typically, a status code should only be assigned to a purchase order when the purchase order needs attention from someone; otherwise, the status should be blank.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Comments</span>: Any comments you want to record at this time.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window. This changes the state of the purchase order.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window <span class="Emphasis">without</span> changing the state of the purchase order.</p>
