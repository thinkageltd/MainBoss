<p>Inventory adjustments are necessary when you need to record a change in your inventory that isn't handled by standard operations. For example, if you accidentally break an item, you should record the loss with an inventory adjustment. This ensures that your inventory records remain up to date.</p>

<p class="box">You do <span class="Emphasis">not</span> have to record inventory adjustments for standard operations like using items during the course of a work order.</p>

<p>To record an adjustment, go to <span class="CPanel">Items</span> | <span class="CPanel">Storeroom Assignments</span> or <span class="CPanel">Coding Definitions</span> | <span class="CPanel">Items</span> | <span class="CPanel">Storeroom Assignments</span> and select the record for the item and the storeroom where you want to make an adjustment. Click <span class="CButton">Edit</span> to open the storeroom assignment record. Then, in the record's <span class="CButton">Item Activity</span> section, drop the arrow on <span class="CButton">New Physical Count</span> and click <span class="CButton">New Item Adjustment</span>. This opens a window where you can record information about the adjustment.</p>

<p class="box">There are other ways to get to the same window. For example, you can start from an adjustment code record and click <span class="CButton">New Item Adjustment</span> in the <span class="CButton">Adjustments</span> section.</p>

<p>The window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Entry Date</span>: A read-only field giving the date that this record was created.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Effective Date</span>: The effective date when the adjustment took place. By default, this is set to the current date and time, but you can set it to some other date/time.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">User Contact</span>: A read-only field giving your user name. This will appear in MainBoss's accounting history to show who made the adjustment.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Storage Assignment</span>: A storeroom assignment record indicating the item and storeroom where the count should be changed. For more on storeroom assignment records, see <a href="StoreroomAssignments.htm">Storeroom Assignments</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Adjustment Code</span>: The adjustment code used for this adjustment. For more on adjustment codes, see <a href="ItemAdjustmentCodes.htm">Item Adjustment Codes</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Quantity</span>: The new quantity on hand in the storeroom. (Remember that quantity on hand is the quantity actually present in the storeroom.)</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">On Hand</span>: Read-only fields giving the quantity of the item on hand in the given storeroom, plus the unit cost and total cost.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Calculated On Hand Cost</span>: A read-only field giving the cost of changing from the old quantity to the new "<span class="CField">Quantity</span>", based on MainBoss's existing pricing information for the item. For example, if you are decreasing the quantity by one because you broke an item, "<span class="CField">Calculated On Hand Cost</span>" is the expected cost of the broken item.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Use calculated On Hand cost</span>: If this box is checkmarked, MainBoss will use "<span class="CField">Calculated On Hand Cost</span>" as the actual cost of the adjustment. If you want to use some other cost, leave the box blank and fill in "<span class="CField">Cost</span>".</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Cost</span>: The cost involved in the adjustment. For example, if the adjustment is necessary because you broke an item, this is the cost of the broken item. You can fill in the "<span class="CField">Unit Cost</span>" column (the cost of a single unit of the item) or the "<span class="CField">Total Cost</span>" (the total cost of the adjustment). Whichever column you fill in, MainBoss automatically fills in the other column. If you checkmark <span class="CButton">Use calculated On Hand cost</span>, MainBoss automatically fills in both columns.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">From Cost Center</span>, <span class="CField">To Cost Center</span>: Read-only fields telling the cost centers involved in this operation. MainBoss creates accounting records indicating the transfer of money from the first cost center to the second. These fields are only visible if your database has an <span class="BL">Accounting</span> license key. For more, see <a href="AccountingFacilities.htm">Accounting Facilities</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
