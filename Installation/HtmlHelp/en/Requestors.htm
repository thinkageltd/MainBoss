<p>A <span class="NewTerm">requestor</span> is someone who is authorized to submit work requests directly to the maintenance department. This may be someone in another department of your organization or a customer served by your organization.</p>

<p>Before adding someone to the requestor list, you should create a record for that person in the <span class="CPanel">Contacts</span> list&#8212;you record the person's contact information first, then specify that the person is an authorized requestor. For more on contacts, see <a href="Contacts.htm">Contacts</a>.</p>

<p><span class="CInset">Licensing Requestors:</span> Your <span class="BL">MainBoss Requests Service</span> license will specify the maximum number of entries allowed to receive acknowledgements in the <span class="CPanel">Requestors</span> list.</p>

<p>Some companies choose to reduce licensing costs by not tracking individual requestors. For example, your <span class="CPanel">Requestors</span> list could contain a few specific people and an entry for <span class="CU">Other</span> that you use for requests from anyone else. By writing up requests from <span class="CU">Other</span>, you save money on your license, but you lose the ability to track requests by requestors. Even if you record the actual requestor's name in the request's "<span class="CField">Comments</span>" field, you lose a lot of convenience&#8212;you can't sort/print/analyze your requests by requestor name, and it becomes difficult to search for a request from a specific requestor. </p>
