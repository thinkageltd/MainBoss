<p>You create or modify work order assignee records by clicking <span class="CButton">New Work Order Assignee</span> or <span class="CButton">Edit</span> in the <span class="CButton">View</span> section of <span class="CPanel">Coding Definitions</span> | <span class="CPanel">Work Orders</span> | <span class="CPanel">Work Order Assignees</span>. The editor contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Details</span> section: Contains basic information about this assignee.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Contact</span>: The name of the assignee, selected from the <span class="CPanel">Contacts</span> table. For more on contacts, see <a href="Contacts.htm">Contacts</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Business Phone</span>, <span class="CField">Email</span>: Information obtained from the <span class="CPanel">Contacts</span> table once you've specified a "<span class="CField">Name</span>".</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Receive Notification</span>: If this is checkmarked, and if your database has the MainBoss Service license key, this assignee will be sent email whenever a history record is created for this work order. In particular, the assignee receives an email notification whenever someone adds a comment to the work order.

<br /><br />In the first notification, assignees will receive the original "<span class="CField">Work Description</span>" of the work order. In subsequent notifications, assignees will receive comments from work order history records, but not the "<span class="CField">Work Description</span>".</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Comments</span>: Any comments you want to associate with this assignee.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Work Order Assignments</span> section: Lists any work orders to which this person has been assigned.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
