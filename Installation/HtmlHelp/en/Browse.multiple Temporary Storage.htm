<p>You may designate temporary storage locations for the materials you use on a work order. For example, if you are doing a substantial renovation, you may decide to store some materials in a room near the work site rather than keep them in a normal storeroom. You should still record where the materials are, so that workers don't have to guess which materials are in temporary storage and which are still back in your standard storerooms.</p>

<p>A temporary storage assignment specifies a location (the storage place) and the work order for which the storage will be used. Temporary storage locations are typically identified by the number of the work order that is using the storage.</p>

<p>You can create a temporary storage location by clicking <span class="CButton">New Temporary Storage</span> in the <span class="CButton">Temporary Storage</span> section of a work order. This opens a window that contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Details</span> section: Shows basic information for the record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Work Order</span>: A work order that will use the given location for temporary storage. (If you started from a work order, this field will already be filled in.) For more on work orders, see <a href="WorkOrders.htm">Work Orders</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Containing Location</span>: A location (from the <span class="CPanel">Locations</span> table) to be used as temporary storage. For more on locations, see <a href="Locations.htm">Locations</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Description</span>: A description of the temporary storage location.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Comments</span>: Any comments you want to associate with the temporary storage record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Temporary Storage Assignments</span> section: Lists any temporary storage assignments associated with this location. For more, see <a href="Edit.Temporary%20Storage%20Assignment.htm">Temporary Storage Assignments</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
