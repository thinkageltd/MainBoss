<p>Storeroom assignment records specify where specific items may be stored. In addition, these records specify control information for the storage locations.</p>

<p>For example, a storeroom assignment record might refer to a storage location like "Bin 3 in Storeroom 1". The record specifies which item is stored there, as well as other information such as the maximum quantity that should be stored in that location and the minimum amount you always want to keep on hand. In other words, a storeroom assignment record specifies:</p>

<ul class="b1"><li>A type of item (for more on inventory items, see <a href="InventoryItemRecords.htm">Inventory Item Records</a>)</li>
<li>One location where that item is stored; this location must be a storeroom or a sublocation within a storeroom (for more on storerooms, see <a href="Storerooms.htm">Storerooms</a>)</li>
<li>An item pricing record giving price information about the item (see <a href="Edit.Item%20Pricing.htm">Item Pricing</a>)</li>
<li>Information about the quantity that can be or should be stored in that location
</li></ul><p>If the same type of item is stored in several locations, you must have a storeroom assignment for each place.</p>

<p>When you reserve materials for use in a job, you specify a storeroom assignment record, not just the item itself. In other words, you don't just reserve any item of the required type, you reserve specific items in specific locations. This ensures that you know where to get the materials you need, and that someone else doesn't use them first.</p>

<p class="box"><span class="CInset">Note:</span> A storeroom assignment record does not specify the actual quantity of an item that's currently in a particular location. It simply states where items of a particular type are allowed to be stored. For example, a storeroom assignment could say "Item X may be stored in Bin Y." The assignment does <span class="Emphasis">not</span> state the current quantity. However, you can use a <span class="NewTerm">physical count</span> to record information about the quantity in a particular location. For more, see <a href="Edit.Physical%20Count.htm">Recording Physical Counts</a>.</p>

<p><span class="CInset">Permanent vs. Temporary Storage Locations:</span> Storeroom assignments deal with <span class="Emphasis">permanent</span> storage locations, as opposed to <span class="NewTerm">temporary</span> storage locations. Temporary storage locations are used in the short term to store materials before and during a specific job; permanent storage locations are used in the long term to store materials that might be used in <span class="Emphasis">any</span> job. For more on temporary storage locations, see <a href="Edit.Temporary%20Storage.htm">Temporary Storage Locations</a>.</p>
