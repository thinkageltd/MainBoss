<p>You view work orders assignments with <span class="CPanel">Work Orders </span>| <span class="CPanel">Work Order Assignments</span>. The list does not show work orders that are closed or void. The window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Assigned to</span>: Click this heading to sort the list by assignee name. Click again to reverse the order (from ascending to descending or vice versa).

<br /><br />The list includes a special entry named <span class="CU">*Unassigned</span>. This is associated with any work orders that do not have assignees.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Work Order Current State History State</span>: Click this heading to sort the list by work order state. Click again to reverse the order.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Work Order Subject</span>: Click this heading to sort the list by work order subject. Click again to reverse the order.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Apply Filter</span>: Lets you set up a <span class="NewTerm">filter</span> to select which records should be shown in the table. For more information, see <a href="Filter.htm">Table Filters</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">New Work Order Assignment</span>: Opens a window to create a new work order assignment.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="Edit.png" alt="Edit" /></span>: This drop-down button offers several possible actions:</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Edit</span>: Opens an editor window to let you edit the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">View</span>: Opens an editor window where you can examine the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Restore</span>: Restores a deleted record. This button is only active if the viewer is in <span class="CU">All</span> mode and if you've selected a deleted record. When you click <span class="CButton">Restore</span>, MainBoss will open a window that lets you examine the contents of the deleted record. If you save the record and close the window, the record will be restored to the <span class="CU">Active</span> list.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="Delete.png" alt="Delete" /></span>: Deletes the record that's currently selected.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span>: Lets you search through the list of records for a particular record. For more information, see <a href="Search.htm">Searching for a Particular Record</a>. The <span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span> button has an accompanying drop-down list containing the following:</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Find Next</span>: Uses the same search condition(s) as your most recent search and finds the next record in the table that matches the condition(s). If the search reaches the end of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the start of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Find Previous</span>: Same as <span class="CButton">Find Next</span> except that it goes backward in the table. If the search reaches the start of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the end of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Add Work Order Comment</span>: Adds a comment to a selected work order. The comment is recorded in a state history record. For more, see <a href="Edit.Work%20Order%20State%20History.htm">Editing Work Order State History Records</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
