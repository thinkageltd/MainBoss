</li></ul><p class="box">Some data and option selections may lead to charts that are difficult to read. In such cases, we recommend using the <span class="CButton">Filters</span> section to reduce the amount of data you're trying to show in a single chart. Breaking your data into multiple charts may make the final results easier to understand.</p>
