<p>You create or modify role records using the Role editor. You can open this editor by clicking <span class="CButton">Edit</span> or <span class="CButton">View</span> in <span class="CPanel">Administration | Security Roles</span>.</p>

<p class="box"><span class="CInset">Note:</span> This version of MainBoss doesn't let you edit the contents of built-in role records. You can, however, edit roles that you have created yourself. You can also use the Role editor window to change the list of users associated with a role.</p>

<p>The role editor window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Details</span> section: Provides general information about the role.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Code</span>: A name for the role.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Description</span>: A description of the role.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Comments</span>: More detailed information about the role.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Permissions</span> section: Lists which permissions are associated with this role. For more, see <a href="Edit.Permission.htm">Permissions</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Users</span> section: Lists which users have this role. You may add or delete users from this list.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
