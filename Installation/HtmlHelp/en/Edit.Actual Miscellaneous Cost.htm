<p>An Actual Miscellaneous record specifies the actual amount of a miscellaneous cost. You specify the cost with a work order miscellaneous record; this record describes the nature of the expense and an expected cost. (For more on miscellaneous costs, see <a href="WorkOrderMiscellaneousCosts.htm">Work Order Miscellaneous Costs</a>.)</p>

<p>The usual way to reach the Actual Miscellaneous editor is to select a Demand Miscellaneous in the <span class="CButton">Miscellaneous Expenses</span> subsection of the <span class="CButton">Resources</span> section of a work order, then click the <span class="CButton">Actualize</span> button. (For more on miscellaneous demands, see <a href="Edit.Demand%20Miscellaneous%20Cost.htm">Demand Miscellaneous</a>.)</p>

<p>The Actual Miscellaneous editor contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Entry Date</span>: A read-only field giving the date that this record was created.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Effective Date</span>: The date/time when the cost was incurred. By default, this is set to the current date/time.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">User Contact</span>: A read-only field giving your name. This will appear in MainBoss's accounting history to show who did the actualization.</p>
<p class="wi">Read-only fields: Provide information relevant to the job. This includes the work order number and the estimated cost from the demand.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Demand Miscellaneous Work Order Cost Demanded Cost</span>: The estimated cost that was stated in the original demand.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Manually Enter Cost</span>: If you select this option, you must enter the actual miscellaneous cost in "<span class="CField">This Entry</span>".</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Use suggested cost</span>: If you select this option, "<span class="CField">This Entry</span>" will be set to the cost as taken from the original miscellaneous cost record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Use demanded cost</span>: If you select this option, "<span class="CField">This Entry</span>" will be set to the cost given in the original estimated demand.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">This Entry</span>: The actual cost of this expense. This will be read-only unless you selected <span class="CButton">Manually Enter Cost</span>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">From Cost Center</span>, <span class="CField">To Cost Center</span>: Read-only fields telling the cost centers involved in this operation. MainBoss creates accounting records indicating the transfer of money from the first cost center to the second. These fields are only visible if your database has an <span class="BL">Accounting</span> license key. For more, see <a href="AccountingFacilities.htm">Accounting Facilities</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
