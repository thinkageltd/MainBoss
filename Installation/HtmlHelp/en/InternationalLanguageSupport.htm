<p>When you start MainBoss, it checks the Regional Settings that you have specified for Microsoft Windows. If your preferred language is supported by MainBoss, the software will run in that language. For example, if you prefer to work in French and your version of MainBoss supports French, MainBoss will operate in French for you (although it may operate in English for some other user).</p>

<p>It's important to understand that MainBoss only translates its own labels and messages, not user data. For example, the priority codes assigned to work orders are created by you, not by MainBoss. Therefore, those codes will never be translated. For example, if you create a code called <span class="CU">Urgent</span>, this word will never be translated into other languages&#8212;it's <span class="Emphasis">your</span> data, not part of MainBoss itself. The same is true of work categories, item names, work order instructions, and much more.</p>

<p>For this reason, trying to operate in more than one language is usually impractical&#8212;if you use multiple languages, everyone working with MainBoss may have to understand all the languages you use.</p>

<p class="box"><span class="CInset">Note:</span> MainBoss depends on various Microsoft software including SQL Server and the Microsoft Report Viewer. This Microsoft software is independent of MainBoss, including language support. In particular, report-viewing facilities will be in the language of your report viewer, which may or may not be the same language used by MainBoss. Similarly, diagnostic messages generated by SQL Server may or may not be in the same language as MainBoss.</p>

<p>Note that changing Regional Settings may also change the currency symbol (e.g. from "$" for dollars to "£" for pounds). However, MainBoss cannot handle multiple currencies; it assumes that all money values are in the same currency. For example, if you enter <span class="CU">33</span> in a "<span class="CField">Unit Cost</span>" field, MainBoss may display the result as <span class="CU">$33.00</span> or <span class="CU">£33.00</span> depending on your Regional Settings...but internally, MainBoss simply record <span class="CU">33.00</span>. Therefore, it is important that all MainBoss users use the same currency for all money values.</p>
