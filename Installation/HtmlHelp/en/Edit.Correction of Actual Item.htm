<p><a href="Edit.Actual%20Item.htm">&lt; Previous section</a>&nbsp; | &nbsp;<a href="TableOfContents.htm">Table of Contents</a>&nbsp; | &nbsp;<a href="Index.htm">Index</a>&nbsp; | &nbsp;<a href="Edit.Actual%20Hourly%20Inside.htm">Next section &gt;</a></p>

<p>To correct an Actual Item record, you start in the <span class="CButton">Items</span> subsection of the <span class="CButton">Resources</span> section of the work order. Select the demand corresponding to the Actual Item you want to correct. Click <span class="CButton">Edit</span> to open the Demand Item record. Go to the <span class="CButton">Actuals</span> section of that record, click on the Actual Item entry you want to correct, then click <span class="CButton">Correct</span>. This opens a window where you can correct the record:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Entry Date</span>: A read-only field giving the date that this record was created.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Effective Date</span>: The date/time when the item was used.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">User Contact</span>: A read-only field giving your name. This will appear in MainBoss's accounting history to show who made the correction.</p>
<p class="wi">Read-only fields: Provide information from the original demand and from storeroom assignment records.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Use all remaining demand</span>: If you checkmark this box, MainBoss completes the record to indicate that you used the quantity listed under "<span class="CField">Remaining Demand</span>". If you leave the box blank, you will have to fill in "<span class="CField">Quantity</span>" yourself.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Quantity</span>: Corrects the quantity actually used. Typically, you fill in the "<span class="CField">As Corrected</span>" field with the actual quantity used&#8212;the correct quantity, as opposed to the quantity you originally recorded. The alternative is to fill in "<span class="CField">This Entry</span>" with the difference between the quantity you originally entered and the true quantity.

<br /><br />For example, suppose you really used 3 but you accidentally typed 1 in the original record. You could fill in "<span class="CField">As Corrected</span>" with 3 (the correct number) or fill in "<span class="CField">This Entry</span>" with 2 (the difference between what you originally typed and the true quantity). Note that "<span class="CField">This Entry</span>" may be a negative number if you originally typed in too much.

<br /><br />If you fill in "<span class="CField">As Corrected</span>", MainBoss automatically sets "<span class="CField">This Entry</span>" and vice versa. (Note that the "<span class="CField">As Corrected</span>" quantity may be the same as the original quantity, if you're correcting the cost, not the quantity.)</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">On Hand</span>, <span class="CField">Calculated On Hand Cost</span>: The quantity of the item present in the specified location and the costs associated with that quantity.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Demanded</span>, <span class="CField">Demanded Cost</span>: The estimated quantity and cost stated in the original demand.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Manually Enter Cost</span>: If you select this option, you must enter the actual cost of the item(s) used in "<span class="CField">This Entry</span>" or "<span class="CField">As Corrected</span>".</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Use calculated On Hand cost</span>: If you select this option, the costs in "<span class="CField">This Entry</span>" and "<span class="CField">As Corrected</span>" will be set using the cost of the item(s) as taken from inventory records.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Use demanded cost</span>: If you select this option, the costs in "<span class="CField">This Entry</span>" and "<span class="CField">As Corrected</span>" will be set using the cost of the item(s) as given in the original estimated demand.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">This Entry</span>, <span class="CField">As Corrected</span>: Corrects the actual cost (if necessary). Typically, you fill in "<span class="CField">As Corrected</span>" with the correct cost of the correct quantity. The alternative is to fill in "<span class="CField">This Entry</span>" with the difference between the cost you originally entered and the true cost.

<br /><br />If you fill in "<span class="CField">As Corrected</span>", MainBoss automatically sets "<span class="CField">This Entry</span>" and vice versa.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">From Cost Center</span>, <span class="CField">To Cost Center</span>: Read-only fields telling the cost centers involved in this operation. MainBoss creates accounting records indicating the transfer of money from the first cost center to the second. These fields are only visible if your database has an <span class="BL">Accounting</span> license key. For more, see <a href="AccountingFacilities.htm">Accounting Facilities</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
