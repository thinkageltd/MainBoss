<p>Much of your work with MainBoss is done using table viewers and editors:</p>

<ul class="b1"><li>A table viewer is a window that shows you a list of things. For example, the Work Order table viewer shows your work orders. Table viewers may also be called <span class="NewTerm">browsers</span>.
</li></ul><ul class="b2"><li>A table viewer window has buttons that let you add new entries to the list, and modify or delete existing entries. For example, the Work Order viewer lets you create new work orders or edit existing ones.</li>
<li>Table viewers also let you search for items. For example, suppose you want to record some information about a piece of equipment. You would open the Units viewer and use it to search your unit list until you found the appropriate piece of equipment. You could then use the table viewer to tell MainBoss that you wanted to edit the information for that piece of equipment.</li>
<li>Table viewers let you print information about items in the list. For example, if you want to print out one or more work orders, you open the Work Order viewer, then click the <span class="CButton"><img src="PrintHS.png" alt="Print" /></span> button.</li>
<li>Table viewers may let you perform additional actions which are specific to the type of information displayed by the viewer. For example, the Requests viewer lets you create a work order from a selected request.
</li></ul>
<ul class="b1"><li>An editor is a window that shows you information about a single thing. For example, the Work Order editor shows information about a particular work order.
</li></ul><ul class="b2"><li>MainBoss opens an editor window when you want to create a new record or edit an old one. For example, when you want to create a new work order, MainBoss opens the Work Order editor window. When the window first appears, all its data fields will be blank or set to default values. You can then specify the information you want.</li>
<li>Later on, if you want to change some of the information in the same work order, you open the Work Order editor again. This time, the editor shows you all the information that you entered when you originally created the work order.
</li></ul>
<p class="box"><span class="CInset">The Basic Principle:</span> A table viewer shows a list of records. An editor shows a single record.</p>
