<p>Requests, work orders, and purchase orders can be assigned to people. Someone assigned to a record is called an <span class="NewTerm">assignee</span>.</p>

<p>Typically, you assign someone to a request if that person has some interest in the request. People who might be assigned to a request include:</p>

<ul class="b1"><li>The requestor</li>
<li>The person who received the request from the requestor (e.g. help-desk personnel)</li>
<li>Whoever is responsible for seeing that the request is handled satisfactorily (e.g. a maintenance supervisor)
</li></ul><p>Similarly, you assign someone to a work order if that person has some interest in the job. People who might be assigned to a work order include:</p>

<ul class="b1"><li>The requestor</li>
<li>The dispatcher who created the work order</li>
<li>Whoever is responsible for seeing that the work is done (e.g. a maintenance supervisor)</li>
<li>A bookkeeper or accountant who has to keep track of work expenses
</li></ul><p class="box">Any worker who appears in a labor demand (inside or outside, hourly or per job) is automatically an assignee for the associated work order (provided that the worker is on the list of recognized Work Order Assignees). You don't have to create an assignment explicitly in the work order's <span class="CButton">Work Order Assignments</span> section.</p>

<p>You assign someone to a purchase order if that person has some interest in the purchase. People who might be assigned to a purchase order include:</p>

<ul class="b1"><li>The vendor</li>
<li>Whoever created the purchase order</li>
<li>Whoever will receive materials specified on the purchase order</li>
<li>A bookkeeper or accountant who has to keep track of purchase expenses
</li></ul><p>Different organizations will have different policies for who is and isn't assigned to a record. For example, an organization might choose to assign requestors to requests but not to work orders. Similarly, help-desk personnel might be assigned to requests but not to work orders associated with those requests.</p>

<p><span class="CInset">Assignee Tables:</span> In order for someone to be assigned to a record, that person must first be in the Contacts table. That person must also be authorized to be an assignee by being in one of the three Assignee tables:</p>

<ul class="b1"><li><span class="CPanel">Coding Definitions</span> | <span class="CPanel">Requests</span> | <span class="CPanel">Request Assignees</span></li>
<li><span class="CPanel">Coding Definitions</span> | <span class="CPanel">Work Orders</span> | <span class="CPanel">Work Order Assignees</span></li>
<li><span class="CPanel">Coding Definitions</span> | <span class="CPanel">Purchase Orders</span> | <span class="CPanel">Purchase Order Assignees</span>
</li></ul><p><span class="CInset">MainBoss Users:</span> When you run MainBoss, you'll see that the control panel has an entry labeled <span class="CPanel">My Assignment Overview</span>. If you expand this entry, you'll see</p>

<ul class="b1"><li><span class="CPanel">In Progress Requests</span></li>
<li><span class="CPanel">Open Work Orders</span></li>
<li><span class="CPanel">Issued Purchase Orders</span>
</li></ul><p>These tables list active requests, work orders, and purchase orders to which you've been assigned. In other words, your <span class="CPanel">My Assignment Overview</span> section lists the requests, work orders and purchase orders that you're most likely to care about.</p>
