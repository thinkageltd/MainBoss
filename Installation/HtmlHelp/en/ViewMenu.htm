<p>The <span class="CMenu">View</span> menu provides options that control how information is displayed:</p>

<ul class="b1"><li><span class="CMenu">Zoom in on View</span>: If you click this menu item, MainBoss will hide the control panel in this window. To bring back the control panel, click <span class="CMenu">Zoom in on View</span> again.</li>
<li><span class="CMenu">Open in New Window</span>: If you select this option, MainBoss opens a new window containing the same information as the current one. This is useful if you want to compare information between tables: you can have two windows open, one showing one table and one showing the other.</li>
<li><span class="CMenu">Change Active Filter</span>: This item lets you change the definition of "active" requests, work orders and purchase orders. For example, you can specify that work orders should only be displayed in table viewers if they're less than three months old. Changes that you make through this menu item affect you but not other users.</li>
<li><span class="CMenu">Show compact browsers</span>: If this is checkmarked, table viewers will not show details from the currently selected record. This makes it possible for a table viewer to list many more records. If the entry is not checkmarked, table viewers will have an area showing the contents of the currectly selected record; this reduces the number of records that the window can show at any one time.
</li></ul><p class="box"><span class="CMenu">Show compact browsers</span> is particularly useful if you have a small monitor screen. Normally, MainBoss requires a screen-size of at least 1280 × 1050.</p>

<ul class="b1"><li><span class="CMenu">Form Customization</span>: Offers a submenu of actions related to customized table viewers, editors, and reports. The submenu contains:
</li></ul><ul class="b2"><li><span class="CMenu">Enable</span>: If this is checkmarked, you can customize table viewers, editors and report windows, as described in "Form Customization" later in this document. If you remove the checkmark, you will not be able to make such customizations. To change your <span class="CMenu">Enable</span> setting, you must have the MainBoss <span class="CU">Administrator</span> security role.</li>
<li><span class="CMenu">Customize Main Menu</span>: Lets you choose which entries appear in the control panel.</li>
<li><span class="CMenu">Publish</span>: This saves all your current form customizations as a single set of "preferred" customizations. You can make other customizations after publishing, but they will be forgotten when you quit MainBoss. Only published customizations are remembered from one session to the next.</li>
<li><span class="CMenu">Restore from published</span>: Gets rid of any customizations you have made since you last clicked <span class="CMenu">Publish</span>. You will return to the preferred customizations you have already saved.</li>
<li><span class="CMenu">Clear all customization</span>: Removes any and all form customizations you have created, restoring everything to MainBoss's default forms. This does <span class="Emphasis">not</span> delete your published customizations; therefore, you can use <span class="CMenu">Restore from published</span> to return to your published customizations.</li>
<li><span class="CMenu">Export</span>: This saves your current customizations in a file. (MainBoss will open a window so you can specify a file name and location.) Saving customizations in a file lets you pass your customizations along to someone else. It also keeps a record of your current customizations if you intend to publish a different set of customizations.</li>
<li><span class="CMenu">Replace from file</span>: Replaces all your current customizations with customizations from a file. The specified file should contain customizations previously saved with <span class="CMenu">Export</span>.</li>
<li><span class="CMenu">Add from file</span>: Adds customizations from a file to your current set of customizations. The customizations will be added to any customizations that already exist; however, if a customization in the file conflicts with one of your current customizations, the customization in the file will replace your current customization.
</li></ul>
<ul class="b1"><li><span class="CMenu">Select View</span>: Contains submenus that reproduce all the entries of the control panel. This is useful for people who would rather work with menus (especially menu shortcut keys) rather than using the mouse to click on the control panel.
</li></ul>
