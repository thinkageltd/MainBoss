<p>A <span class="NewTerm">specification</span> records information about a unit. For example, specifications on an electric motor might include voltage, amps, RPM, horsepower, fuse sizes, bearing sizes, a list of tools needed for various operations, and so on. Workers can look at such information to find out in advance what they might need when going out to repair the unit.</p>

<p>Specification information is recorded using a <span class="NewTerm">specification form</span>. You create your own specification forms (as discussed in <a href="SpecificationForms.htm">Specification Forms</a>). Each form contains whatever information you consider useful about a particular type of unit. Before you can enter specification information about a unit, you must create an appropriate form.</p>

<p>A single unit may have more than one specification. For example, consider different types of vehicles: cars, trucks, etc. You might create one specification form for engines: a form that you can use for every type of vehicles. In addition, you might create one form that contains additional information for cars, a form that contains additional information for trucks, a form that contains additional information for forklifts, and so on. Each vehicle then has two associated forms: one for its engine, and one for everything else.</p>

<p>You enter specification information using the <span class="CButton">Specifications</span> section of a unit record. To begin, add a new specification, select a specification form using the drop-down list immediately below the list of current specifications. Once you have selected a form, click <span class="CButton">New</span> beside the drop-down list. MainBoss opens a window that contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Specification Form</span>: A read-only field giving the name of the specification form that you've selected.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Code</span>: An identification code for this specification.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Description</span>: A more detailed description of what the specification contains.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Unit</span>: A read-only field identifying the unit whose information you're recording.</p>
<p class="wi">Specification fields: The fields associated with the chosen specification form. You fill in these fields with the appropriate information. For example, if you see fields labeled <span class="CU">Voltage</span>, <span class="CU">RPM</span>, etc., you fill in those fields with the appropriate information for the given "<span class="CField">Unit</span>".</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Comments</span>: Any comments you want to associate with this specification. For example, this might be used to record additional information not covered by the form.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
