<p>There are many situations in which units may be owned by individuals or groups, either in different departments of your organization or by third parties. Here are some typical ownerships:</p>

<pre>Department A
Tenant B
Chris Smith</pre>

<p>While you don't have to create any ownerships at all, they are useful for organizing reports and for getting detailed breakdowns on time and expenses.</p>
