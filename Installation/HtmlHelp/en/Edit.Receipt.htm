<p>A receipt describes goods and/or services that you've received from a vendor. To create a receipt, go to <span class="CPanel">Purchase Orders</span> | <span class="CPanel">Receipts</span> and click the <span class="CButton">New Receipt</span> button. This opens a window that contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Details</span> section: Basic information about the receipt.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Entry Date</span>: The date/time when the goods and/or services were received. By default, this is set to the current date/time.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Purchase Order</span>: The purchase order to which this receipt is responding. For more on purchase orders, see <a href="PurchaseOrders.htm">Purchase Orders</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Purchase Order Vendor</span>: A read-only field giving the vendor associated with "<span class="CField">Purchase Order</span>".</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Waybill</span>: A brief code identifying this receipt.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Reference</span>: Any reference number that might be associated with the actual shipment (e.g. vendor's delivery code).</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Description</span>: A more detailed description of the shipment.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Comments</span>: Any comments you want to record in connection with this shipment.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Receipt Activity</span> section: Lists the goods and/or services that you received. Each line in the list refers to a separate item or service.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Receive</span>: Opens a window to record the receipt of the selected line item. The line item may be an inventory item, an outside labor expense, or a miscellaneous item.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Correct</span>: Lets you change an existing receipt entry. Clicking the button opens an appropriate window that gives you the opportunity to change what was previously recorded. For more, see <a href="Edit.Correction%20of%20Receive%20Item%20(with%20PO).htm">Correcting Receive Item Entries</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Edit.png" alt="Edit" /></span>: This drop-down button offers several possible actions:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Edit</span>: Opens an editor window to let you edit the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">View</span>: Opens an editor window where you can examine the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span>: Searches the list for a specific entry.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the receipt. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the receipt and sets up the window for you to enter a new receipt. Fields in the new receipt will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the receipt and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
