<p>You can associate work orders with purchase orders using the <span class="CButton">Work Orders</span> section of a purchase order or the <span class="CButton">Purchase Orders</span> section of a work order. Clicking <span class="CButton">New Work Order Purchase Order</span> in either section opens a window that contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Work Order</span>: The work order that you want to associate with the purchase order. If you started from a work order, this field is read-only.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Purchase Order</span>: The purchase order that you want to associate with the work order. If you started from a purchase order, this field is read only.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
