<p>The control panel entry <span class="CPanel">Requests</span> | <span class="CPanel">In Progress Requests</span> | <span class="CPanel">In Progress Requests with no linked Work Orders</span> lists any requests that are "In Progress" but do not have any work orders linked to them. Typically, this means that the requests have been accepted by the maintenance department&#8212;they have been marked as "In Progress"&#8212;but which have not yet led to a work order. By looking at this table, a maintenance dispatcher can easily determine which requests need work orders. (Of course, there's always a possibility that there's an existing work order to deal with this request, especially if several people report the same problem. In this case, you just have to link the request to the existing work order.)</p>

<p>The fields of this table viewer are exactly like the fields of <span class="CPanel">Requests</span> | <span class="CPanel">In Progress Requests</span>. For more information, see <a href="Browse.In%20Progress%20Request.htm">Viewing In Progress Requests</a>.</p>
