<p>A <span class="NewTerm">receipt</span> records the contents of a shipment from a vendor. Receipts may also record the receipt of services from a vendor (e.g. when an outside contractor does work for you).</p>

<p>Receipts occur in response to a specific purchase order. If a single shipment contains items specified by several different purchase orders, you should break the shipment up into multiple receipts: one for each original purchase order. For more on purchase orders, see <a href="PurchaseOrders.htm">Purchase Orders</a>.</p>

<p>Whenever you receive a shipment, you should start a new receipt record using <span class="CPanel">Purchase Orders</span> | <span class="CPanel">Receipts</span>. Each receipt needs an identifier called the <span class="NewTerm">waybill number</span> or simply the waybill. The receipt also has line items listing the goods and/or services that were delivered. Each receipt line item should refer back to a line item in an existing purchase order, indicating where the good/service was originally ordered.</p>

<p>For information on viewing receipts, see <a href="Browse.Receipt.htm">Viewing Receipts</a>. For more on creating and editing receipts, see <a href="Edit.Receipt.htm">Editing Receipts</a>.</p>
