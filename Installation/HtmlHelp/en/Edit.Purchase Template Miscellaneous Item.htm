<p>Clicking <span class="CButton">New Purchase Template Miscellaneous Item</span> in the <span class="CButton">Purchase Order Template Lines</span> section of a purchase order template opens a window that lets you add a miscellaneous item to the template. This window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Line Number Rank</span>: A number indicating where this item should be placed on generated purchase orders. This is useful when a task has multiple purchase templates associated with it, and line items from the different templates must be merged to make a single purchase order.

<br /><br />Line items on the generated purchase order will be sorted from lowest rank number to highest (so an item numbered 1 will come before one numbered 2). Ranks do not have to be completely sequential (so that you might have ranks, 1, 4, 5, 10, with gaps between the numbers). If multiple items have the same rank, MainBoss will randomly choose which one goes first.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Purchase Order Template</span>: A read-only field identifying the purchase order template where this miscellaneous item will appear.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Miscellaneous</span> area: This area ends with a drop-down list where you can specify a miscellaneous item.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Only include Miscellaneous items previously provided by this vendor</span>: If you checkmark this box, the drop-down list on the next line only shows miscellaneous items that have been used in previous purchase orders to this vendor.</p>
<p class="wi2">Drop-down list: The drop-down list at the end of the "<span class="CField">Miscellaneous</span>" area shows miscellaneous items that satisfy any option you have specified.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Miscellaneous Cost</span>: A read-only field giving the unit cost from the specified "<span class="CField">Miscellaneous</span>".</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Miscellaneous Order Line Text</span>: A read-only field giving the text from "<span class="CField">Miscellaneous</span>" that will appear on any generated purchase orders.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Quantity</span>: The quantity of the miscellaneous item that you want to order.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
