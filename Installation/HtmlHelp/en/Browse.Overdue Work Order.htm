<p>You view overdue work orders with <span class="CPanel">Work Orders</span> | <span class="CPanel">Overdue Work Orders</span>.</p>

<p class="box">A work order is overdue if it is open and its "<span class="CField">Work End Date</span>" has passed but the work order has not yet been closed.</p>

<p>The overdue work order table viewer contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Number</span>: Click this heading to sort the list by work order number. Click again to reverse the order (from ascending to descending or vice versa).</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Priority</span>: Click this heading to sort the list by priority. Click again to reverse the order.</p>
<p class="box">Work orders with explicit priorities are considered more urgent than ones where the priority field is blank. Therefore, if you sort your work orders by priority, those with no explicit priority will come last.</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Current State History Status</span>: Click this heading to sort the list by work order status. Click again to reverse the order.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Subject</span>: Click this heading to sort the list by subject. Click again to reverse the order.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Apply Filter</span>: Lets you set up a <span class="NewTerm">filter</span> to select which records should be shown in the table. For more information, see <a href="Filter.htm">Table Filters</a>.</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="Edit.png" alt="Edit" /></span>: This drop-down button offers several possible actions:</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Edit</span>: Opens an editor window to let you edit the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">View</span>: Opens an editor window where you can examine the selected record.</p>

<p class="wi">State change actions: A drop-down button which offers a list of actions that can be used to change the state of the work order. The current state of the work order determines which actions are enabled; it also determines which action is displayed as the label for the button. Since all overdue work orders are in the open state, the only enabled state-change actions are:</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Close Work Order</span>: Changes an open work order into a closed one. Closing a work order suggests that the job is finished and you have recorded all relevant information about the work.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Close Work Order (With Comment)</span>: Same as <span class="CButton">Close Work Order</span>, except that MainBoss will also open a window where you can record a comment about what you're doing.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Suspend</span>: Changes an open work order into a draft one. You might do this if you find that you need to make significant changes to the work order. MainBoss opens a window where you may record a comment explaining why you're suspending the work order.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span>: Lets you search through the list of records for a particular record. For more information, see <a href="Search.htm">Searching for a Particular Record</a>. The <span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span> button has an accompanying drop-down list containing the following:</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Find Next</span>: Uses the same search condition(s) as your most recent search and finds the next record in the table that matches the condition(s). If the search reaches the end of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the start of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Find Previous</span>: Same as <span class="CButton">Find Next</span> except that it goes backward in the table. If the search reaches the start of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the end of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Add Work Order Comment</span>: Adds a comment to the selected work order. The comment is recorded in a state history record. For more, see <a href="Edit.Work Order State History.htm">Editing Work Order State History Records</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
