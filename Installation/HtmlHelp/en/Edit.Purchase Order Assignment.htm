<p>You can assign someone to a purchase order, provided that the person has an entry in the Purchase Orders Assignees table (<span class="CPanel">Coding Definitions</span> | <span class="CPanel">Purchase Orders</span> | <span class="CPanel">Assignees</span>). When someone is assigned to a purchase order, it indicates that the person has some interest in the purchase order. For further information on assignments, see <a href="Assignments.htm">Assignments</a>.</p>

<p>To assign someone to a purchase order, click the <span class="CButton">New Purchase Order Assignment</span> button in the <span class="CButton">Purchase Order Assignments</span> section of a purchase order. This opens a window that contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Purchase Order</span> area: If you started from a purchase order record, this area will contain a read-only field identifying the purchase order.

<br /><br />If you started from a purchase order assignee record, the <span class="CField">Purchase Order</span> area allows you to choose one or more purchase orders to which the person should be assigned. You specify these purchase orders using the multi-select drop-down list at the bottom of the <span class="CField">Purchase Order</span> area. Option buttons in the <span class="CField">Purchase Order</span> area let you shorten the contents of the drop-down list, to make it easier to choose the purchase orders you want. The option buttons include:</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Only show Draft Purchase Orders</span>: If you choose this option, the drop-down list will only show purchase orders in the Draft state.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Only show Issued Purchase Orders</span>: If you choose this option, the drop-down list will only show purchase orders in the Issued state.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Only show Closed Purchase Orders</span>: If you choose this option, the drop-down list will only show purchase orders in the Closed state.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Show all Purchase Orders</span>: If you choose this option, the drop-down list shows all purchase orders.</p>
<p class="wi2">Drop-down list: A list of all purchase orders that match the criteria specified above.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Assignee</span> area: If you started from a purchase order assignee record, this area will contain a read-only field identifying the purchase order assignee.

<br /><br />If you started from a purchase order record, the <span class="CField">Assignee</span> area lets you specify one or more people to whom you are assigning to this purchase order. The bottom of the area contains a multi-select drop-down list where you can specify the assignees. The options in the area let you reduce the number of possibilities shown in the drop-down list.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Show prospects for Purchase Order Assignee for this Purchase Order</span>: If you click this option, the drop-down list will only show people who are already associated with this purchase order in some way (e.g. vendors).</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Show all Assignees not currently assigned to this Purchase Order</span>: If you click this option, the drop-down list will show everyone in the Purchase Order Assignee table who isn't already assigned to this purchase order.</p>
<p class="wi2">Drop-down list: A list of all potential assignees who match the criteria specified above.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
