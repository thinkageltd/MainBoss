<p>Miscellaneous work order costs cover anything besides labor expenses and direct costs of materials. For example, if you have to rent special equipment in order to do a particular job, you may choose to record that as a miscellaneous expense. Similarly, if a worker is sent out on a job and has to pay for parking, the cost could be a miscellaneous expense.</p>

<p>Before you can specify miscellaneous expenses on a work order, you must create a "work order miscellaneous" record for each such expense. This record describes the nature of the expense, the expected cost, and which cost center should be charged.</p>

<p class="box"><span class="CInset">Note:</span> There is no connection between purchase order miscellaneous items and work order miscellaneous items. A purchase order miscellaneous item is typically an extra cost associated with the act of purchasing (e.g. sales tax). A work order miscellaneous item is typically an extra cost associated with doing a job (e.g. parking for a worker).</p>
