<p>You create or modify purchase order templates using the appropriate editor. The usual way to open the editor is to click <span class="CButton">New Purchase Order Template</span> or <span class="CButton">Edit</span> in the <span class="CButton">View</span> section of <span class="CPanel">Coding Definitions</span> | <span class="CPanel">Unit Maintenance Plans</span> | <span class="CPanel">Purchase Order Templates</span>.</p>

<p>The editor window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Details</span> section: Shows basic information for the record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Code</span>: A brief code to identify this record. No two records may have the same code.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Description</span>: A longer description of the purchase order template.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Summary</span>: The text that should be used for the "<span class="CField">Subject</span>" line of purchase orders created from this template.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Initial State</span>: Whenever MainBoss creates a work order from a task record, it automatically creates purchase orders from any templates associated with the task. "<span class="CField">Initial State</span>" specifies the state for such newly created purchase orders. The initial state can be Closed, Issued, Open, or Voided. For example, if you set "<span class="CField">Initial State</span>" to Issued, any purchase order created from this record will be put into the Issued state as soon as it's created.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Required By Interval</span>: A number used to determine the date by which the goods and/or services are required. This number signifies a number of days after the effective date of the generated work order. For example, suppose that when a work order is generated from a task, the work order's effective date is June 1. Also supposed that the template's "<span class="CField">Required By Interval</span>" is 3. Then the "<span class="CField">Required By Date</span>" on the purchase order generated from the template will be June 4.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Vendor</span>: The outside contractor or supplier who will satisfy the generated purchase order. The vendor should be in your <span class="CPanel">Vendors</span> table. (For more on vendors, see <a href="Vendors.htm">Vendors</a>.)</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Purchase Order Category</span>: A category for this purchase order template. For more on purchase order categories, see <a href="PurchaseOrderCategories.htm">Purchase Order Categories</a> on page 174.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Payment Term</span>: How the purchase order should be paid. For more, see <a href="PaymentTerms.htm">Payment Terms</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Shipping Mode</span>: How the goods should be shipped. For more, see <a href="ShippingModes.htm">Shipping Modes</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Ship to Location</span>: Where the goods should be delivered. This should be a location from your <span class="CPanel">Locations</span> table. For more on locations, see <a href="Locations.htm">Locations</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Project</span>: A project that should be associated with this purchase order template. For more on projects, see <a href="Projects.htm">Projects</a> on page 405.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Comment to Vendor</span>: Comments that should be printed on the purchase order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Comments</span>: Internal comments for maintenance personnel. These will <span class="Emphasis">not</span> be printed on the purchase order but will be recorded in MainBoss's files.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Select for Printing</span>: If this box is checkmarked, purchase orders generated from this template will have their <span class="CButton">Select for Printing</span> checkmarked.
