<p>MainBoss consists of a number of modules. You can pick and choose which modules you want, licensing only the modules that you actually intend to use.</p>

<p>Modules are controlled by license keys. If you do not have a license key for a particular module, information related to that module will not be displayed in the MainBoss control panel or in MainBoss windows. For example, if you do not license the MainBoss Service module, you will not see <span class="CPanel">Administration</span> | <span class="CPanel">MainBoss Service</span> in the control panel.</p>

<p>Below we list MainBoss's modules and give an overview of what MainBoss features are associated with the module.</p>

<dl><dt>The <span class="BL">MainBoss</span> module</dt>
<dd>Supports work orders and units. It lets you track the materials you use on work orders, but does not provide inventory control (e.g. where specific items are stored in your storerooms). It also lets you track labor by your own employees and by outside contractors.

<br /><br />Your <span class="BL">MainBoss</span> module license specifies how many users can appear in the Users table (<span class="CPanel">Administration</span> | <span class="CPanel">Users</span>).

<br /><br />All other modules require the <span class="BL">MainBoss</span> module.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>The <span class="BL">Planned Maintenance</span> module</dt>
<dd>Adds facilities for automatically creating planned maintenance work orders (e.g. inspections and preventive maintenance jobs). Planned maintenance can be scheduled by date or by meter reading.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>The <span class="BL">Inventory</span> module</dt>
<dd>Adds the ability to track the location of materials in storerooms. This includes the ability to specify maximum and minimum quantities desired for each item in each storeroom, plus facilities for taking physical inventory and tracking item prices.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>The <span class="BL">Purchasing</span> module</dt>
<dd>Adds facilities for creating purchase orders and tracking the receipt of ordered items. Purchase orders can include the cost of materials, outside contractors, and miscellaneous expenses.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>The <span class="BL">MainBoss Requests</span> module</dt>
<dd>Supports work requests. As noted in <a href="BasicTerminology.htm">Basic Terminology</a>, a request is a simple problem report that might be written up by a help-desk.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>The <span class="BL">MainBoss Service</span> module</dt>
<dd>[Requires the <span class="BL">MainBoss Requests</span> module] Provides a facility that automatically processes work requests submitted by email. This module also emails out notifications to assignees when a new history record is created for a request, work order or purchase order.</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>The <span class="BL">Accounting</span> module</dt>
<dd>Adds a facility that creates accounting records of a form that may be useful in connection with accounting software. At present, however, MainBoss has no facilities for integrating MainBoss accounting records with any other accounting package.</dd></dl>
