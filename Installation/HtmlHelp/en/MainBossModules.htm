<p>MainBoss consists of a number of modules. You can pick and choose which modules you want, licensing only the modules that you actually intend to use.</p>

<p>Modules are controlled by license keys. If you do not have a license key for a particular module, information related to that module will not be displayed in the MainBoss control panel or in MainBoss windows. For example, if you do not license the MainBoss Service module, you will not see <span class="CPanel">Administration</span> | <span class="CPanel">MainBoss Service</span> in the control panel.</p>

<p>Below we list MainBoss's modules and give an overview of what MainBoss features are associated with the module.</p>
