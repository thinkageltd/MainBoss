<p>You view units with <span class="CPanel">Units</span> or <span class="CPanel">Coding Definitions</span> | <span class="CPanel">Units</span>. The window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">View</span> section: Displays information about units in current use.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Code</span> view: Contains a map of units and their locations. <span class="Emphasis">The map only shows locations that currently contain units.</span> You can open or close locations and units by clicking the <span class="CU">+</span> or <span class="CU">-</span> sign beside them. When you open a location or unit, you see the locations/units that it contains.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Description</span>: Descriptions of the associated units. When you click this heading, MainBoss sorts the units within each location by the unit's "<span class="CField">Description</span>" field (ascending alphabetical order). Click again to reverse the order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Apply Filter</span>: Lets you set up a <span class="NewTerm">filter</span> to select which records should be shown in the table. For more information, see <a href="Filter.htm">Table Filters</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Details</span> section: Shows basic information from the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Service</span> section: Shows any service contracts associated with the selected unit. For more, see <a href="ServiceContracts.htm">Service Contracts</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Related</span> section: Shows any relationships this unit has. For more, see <a href="Relationships.htm">Relationships</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Parts</span> section: Shows any spare parts associated with the selected unit. For more, see <a href="SpareParts.htm">Spare Parts</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Specifications</span> section: Shows any specifications associated with the selected unit. For more, see <a href="Edit.Specification.htm">Specifications</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Value</span> Section: Shows information on the unit's purchase value, scrap value (if any), and replacement costs.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Meters</span> section: Shows any meters associated with the selected unit. For more, see <a href="Meters.htm">Meters</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Attachments</span> section: Shows any attachments associated with the selected unit. For more, see <a href="Edit.Attachment.htm">Attachments</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Requests</span> section: Shows any requests associated with the selected unit. For more, see <a href="Requests.htm">Requests</a>.</p>

<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Temporary Storage and Items</span> section: Shows any temporary storage locations and assignments associated with the selected unit. For more, see <a href="Edit.Temporary%20Storage.htm">Temporary Storage Locations</a> and <a href="Edit.Temporary%20Storage%20Assignment.htm">Temporary Storage Assignments</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">New Unit</span>: Opens a window to create a new unit record. Fields in the new record will either be blank or assigned default values (as specified in the <span class="CButton">Defaults for Units</span> section).</p>
<p class="box"><span class="CInset">Note:</span> If you have not set a default location, the "<span class="CField">Location</span>" field in the new unit record will initially be set to the unit that was highlighted at the time you clicked <span class="CButton">New Unit</span>.</p>

<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Edit.png" alt="Edit" /></span>: This drop-down button offers several possible actions:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Edit</span>: Opens an editor window to let you edit the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">View</span>: Opens an editor window where you can examine the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Restore</span>: Restores a deleted record. This button is only active if the viewer is in <span class="CU">All</span> mode and if you've selected a deleted record. When you click <span class="CButton">Restore</span>, MainBoss will open a window that lets you examine the contents of the deleted record. If you save the record and close the window, the record will be restored to the <span class="CU">Active</span> list.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Show on Map</span>: If the currently selected unit record has a "<span class="CField">GIS Location</span>" value, MainBoss attempts to open Google Maps to a map showing the unit's geographic location. If the current unit record doesn't have a GIS location, MainBoss checks the unit and/or location record that contains the current unit, then the container of the container, and so on, until MainBoss either finds a record that has a GIS location or else reaches a record with no container.

<br /><br />If MainBoss finds no record with a GIS location, but does find a postal address record containing postal information, MainBoss passes the postal information to Google Maps.

<br /><br />In order to see the geographic location in Google Maps, you must have an active Internet connection and a suitable web browser.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Delete.png" alt="Delete" /></span>: Deletes the record that's currently selected.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="PrintHS.png" alt="Print" /></span>: Opens a window to print unit information. For more, see <a href="Report.Unit.htm">Unit Report</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Export.png" alt="Export" /></span>: Lets you export data from this table or import data from a file (provided that the file is in an acceptable format). For more information, see <a href="ImportingandExportingDatainTables.htm">Importing and Exporting Data in Tables</a>.

<br /><br />The button has an accompanying drop-down list containing the following:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Export</span>: Exports data in XML format.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Import</span>: Imports data from a properly formatted file.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Save XML Schema</span>: Writes an XML schema for this table into a specified file.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span>: Lets you search through the list of records for a particular record. For more information, see <a href="Search.htm">Searching for a Particular Record</a>. The <span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span> button has an accompanying drop-down list containing the following:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Find Next</span>: Uses the same search condition(s) as your most recent search and finds the next record in the table that matches the condition(s). If the search reaches the end of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the start of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Find Previous</span>: Same as <span class="CButton">Find Next</span> except that it goes backward in the table. If the search reaches the start of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the end of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Defaults for Units</span> section: Shows any defaults to be used when creating new units.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Edit Defaults</span>: Opens a window to let you change the displayed default values.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
<p><span class="CInset">Expanding or Contracting the Table:</span> The first time you go to the <span class="CPanel">Units</span> table viewer during a session, some people want the table to be fully contracted (only showing locations) and others want the table full expanded (showing all units, sub-units, etc.). You can control which you get by setting an appropropriate form customization.</p>

<p>First, go to the <span class="CPanel">Units</span> table and right-click on the list of units. The resulting menu has an entry labeled <span class="CMenu">Expand New Entries</span>. If this entry is checkmarked, the table will be fully expanded at the beginning of each MainBoss session; if the entry is not checkmarked, the table will be fully contracted.</p>

<p>To change this default, click on <span class="CMenu">Expand New Entries</span> so that it is checkmarked or not, according to your preference. Then create a named form customization for the current options, as described in <a href="CustomizedTableSettings.htm">Customized Table Settings</a>. Make this customization the default for the table by dropping the customization arrow and clicking <span class="CMenu">Set as default</span>. From this point on, every time you start MainBoss, the <span class="CPanel">Units</span> table will be expanded or contracted as you have just specified. (This will not take effect until the next time you start MainBoss.)</p>
