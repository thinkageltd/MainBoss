<p>The hourly inside table lists hourly rates for work done by your employees. (For more on employees, see <a href="Employees.htm">Employees</a>.) Hourly inside records say, "For this type of employee on this type of job, our costs are $X an hour."</p>

<p>For example, suppose you pay the same hourly rate for all your licensed electricians. In this case, you only need to create one hourly inside record specifying this rate; in the employees table, you assign this hourly inside rate to all your electricians. On the other hand, if you have different grades of electricians being paid at different rates (or if each electrician gets paid a distinct rate), you need to create hourly inside records for each possible rate.</p>

<p>You only need to create hourly inside records for the rates that you actually pay. If, for example, you pay the same hourly rate for all employees, you only need one hourly inside record.</p>

<p class="box"><span class="CInset">Note:</span> If a worker's hourly rate changes, there's a special procedure you should follow to make sure your records stay correct. For more information, see the section titled <span class="Emphasis">Rate Changes</span> in the MainBoss Configuration guide.</p>
