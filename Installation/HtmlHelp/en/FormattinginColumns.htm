<p>Many reports have a <span class="CButton">Show Report in Columns</span> option in the <span class="CButton">Advanced</span> section. This organizes a report so that there is a single "line" for each record in the report, with the fields of each line broken up into separate columns. This format can be useful if you only want to see a few pieces of information from each record (as dictated by the <span class="CButton">Show Fields</span> checkboxes). However, it becomes unreadable if you try to cram too many pieces of information on a single line.</p>

<p>Note that if you print out the report in <span class="Emphasis">landscape</span> format rather than <span class="Emphasis">portrait</span>, you can put more on a line without losing readability. To change the format, use the "Page Setup" button near the top of the <span class="CButton">Preview</span> section.</p>

<p>The column format is particularly useful if you intend to export the report's data to Microsoft Excel. In this case, it doesn't matter if the columns don't fit well on a piece of paper&#8212;in Excel, you can expand the columns so that they're readable on your computer screen.</p>
