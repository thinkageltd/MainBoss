<p>MainBoss can schedule planned maintenance by meter reading. For example, if a car needs an oil change every 3000 miles, MainBoss can schedule the work when you reach the 3000-mile mark. In fact, MainBoss can estimate in advance when the car is likely to reach 3000 miles and schedule the oil change based on the estimate. However, this only works if you record mileage readings on a regular basis: that way, MainBoss has up-to-date mileage figures and can determine the average distance driven in a day.</p>

<p>It's useful to record meter readings on a regular basis, even if you don't use them for scheduling planned maintenance. Meter readings show you patterns of use, and may make it easier to diagnose or avoid problems. For example, if you notice a sudden increase or decrease of use for a piece of equipment, maybe you should adjust your lubrication schedules.</p>

<p class="box"><span class="CInset">Important:</span> MainBoss will not let you enter a meter reading with an "<span class="CField">Effective Date</span>" that is older than the most recent reading on the meter. You must enter meter readings in chronological order. This is especially important during set-up: if you want to enter old meter readings (to create a meter history), you must enter the readings in the order they occurred. If you want to enter older meter readings, you have to delete any more recent readings first.</p>
