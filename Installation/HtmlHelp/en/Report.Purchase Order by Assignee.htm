<p>The Purchase Orders by Assignee report prints full purchase orders grouped by assignee. For example, suppose you assign purchase orders to vendors A, B and C. The report would print out all of A's purchase orders, then all of B's, then all of C's. This makes it easy to print off your vendors' assigned purchase orders in batches, so that each vendor gets a copy of the relevant purchase orders.</p>

<p>If a purchase order has more than one assignee, the purchase order will be printed multiple times, once for each corresponding assignee.</p>

<p>To print a Purchase Order by Assignee report, use <span class="CPanel">Purchase Orders</span> | <span class="CPanel">Reports</span> | <span class="CPanel">Purchase Orders by Assignee</span>. This opens a window that contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Sorting</span> section: Options controlling how records are sorted within each section and sub-section.</p>
<p class="box">For more on how to use <span class="CButton">Sorting</span>, see <a href="ReportSections.htm">Report Sections</a>.</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Filters</span> section: Options controlling what kind of purchase orders will be included in the report. For more information, see <a href="ReportFilter.htm">Report Filters</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Include Inactive records</span>: If this checkbox is checkmarked, all relevant records will be included in the report, no matter how old they are. If this checkbox is blank, only active records will be included; this means that old "inactive" records will be ignored.

<br /><br />For more about the active filter, see <a href="Edit.Active Filter.htm">The Active Filter</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Field Selection</span> section: Options controlling which information fields will be included in the report.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Suppress Costs</span>: Omits any money information that might otherwise be displayed in the report.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Advanced</span> section: Miscellaneous options.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Report width in pages</span>: Makes it possible to have lines that are wider than a single page. This is particularly useful when you are previewing reports on a monitor screen. For further information, see <a href="ReportSections.htm">Report Sections</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Title</span>: The title to be printed at the beginning of the report.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Main Font</span>: The font that will be used for most of the characters in the report. This should be a font that is supported by both your Windows system and your printer.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Fixed-width Font</span>: The font that will be used for information that is printed with fixed-width characters (mostly unit specifications). This should be a font that is supported by both your Windows system and your printer.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Additional blank lines</span>: May be filled in with a number. If so, MainBoss will add that number of blank lines to each purchase order. This space can be used to write in any extra information that might be needed.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Additional information</span>: Extra information to be printed in the purchase order. For example, you can use this area to specify a line reading <span class="CU">Authorized by</span> which would then be followed by the signature of someone authorizing the purchase.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Preview</span> section: Displays a visual preview of the report. If you click the <span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span> button, you automatically go to this section.

<br /><br />The <span class="CButton">Preview</span> section contains buttons for looking through the report preview and for actually printing the information. For more on using the <span class="CButton">Preview</span> section, see <a href="ReportButtons.htm">Report Buttons</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="PrintHS.png" alt="Print" /></span>: Immediately prints the report.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Export Data</span>: Exports the report's data in XML format.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Clear Select for Printing</span>: If you click this button, MainBoss removes the checkmark from all <span class="CButton">Select for Printing</span> boxes on all purchase orders. Typically, you do this after printing purchase orders that have been marked <span class="CButton">Select for Printing</span>. For more, see <a href="SelectPrintFlags.htm">Select Print Flags</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Cancels the preparation and printing of a report. This button is enabled only when MainBoss is preparing a report, i.e. gathering the data and formatting it. For more information, see <a href="ReportButtons.htm">Report Buttons</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Clicking this button generates a preview of the report, displayed in the <span class="CButton">Preview</span> section of the window.</p>
