<p>MainBoss lets you customize the message strings used by MainBoss Service and to translate those strings into other languages. For more information, see <a href="Edit.Message.htm">Editing MainBoss Service Messages</a>.</p>

<p class="box">Note that comments to requestors written by MainBoss users are not translated&#8212;they remain in whatever language the commenter used.</p>

<p>The message translation window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Language Code Identifier</span>: Specifies the language of the string. If you drop down the arrow, you will see all the languages recognized by Microsoft Windows.

<br /><br />In many cases, Windows allows for regional variations in a particular language. For example, you'll see that there are entries for <span class="CU">French (Belgium)</span>, <span class="CU">French (Canada)</span>, <span class="CU">French (France)</span>, and so on. If a user sets his or her personal regional preferences to <span class="CU">French (Canada)</span>, MainBoss will first look to see if such a translation exists; if not, MainBoss will look for <span class="CU">French</span> (without any regional variation); if that doesn't exist either, MainBoss will use the default language.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Translation</span>: The message string you want to use in the given language. MainBoss does not impose any length limitation on this string. However, other software might. For example, some email programs limit the length of a message's subject line; if the string for <span class="CU">RequestorNotificationSubjectPrefix</span> is too long, the email program may truncate it or take some other action.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
