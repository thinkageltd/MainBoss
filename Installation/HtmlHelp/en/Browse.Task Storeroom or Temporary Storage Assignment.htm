<p>You view storeroom assignments with <span class="CPanel">Items</span> | <span class="CPanel">Storeroom Assignments</span> or <span class="CPanel">Coding Definitions</span> | <span class="CPanel">Items</span> | <span class="CPanel">Storeroom Assignments</span>. The window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">View</span> section: Shows the list of current storeroom assignments.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Code</span>: Depicts the location of items using a location map. The picture only shows locations that contain storerooms, the storerooms themselves, sublocations within the storerooms, and items at such sublocations. For more on storerooms, see <a href="Storerooms.htm">Storerooms</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Description</span>: A description of the item, as given in the item record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Available</span>: The current quantity of the item that's available in the given storeroom.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Apply Filter</span>: Lets you set up a <span class="NewTerm">filter</span> to select which records should be shown in the table. For more information, see <a href="Filter.htm">Table Filters</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Details</span> section: Shows basic information from the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Item Activity</span> section: Shows inventory activity for the selected item in the specified storeroom.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">New Storeroom Assignment</span>: Opens a window to create a new storeroom assignment. Fields in the new record will either be blank or assigned default values (as specified in the <span class="CButton">Defaults for Storeroom Assignments</span> section).</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Edit.png" alt="Edit" /></span>: This drop-down button offers several possible actions:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Edit</span>: Opens an editor window to let you edit the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">View</span>: Opens an editor window where you can examine the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Restore</span>: Restores a deleted record. This button is only active if the viewer is in <span class="CU">All</span> mode and if you've selected a deleted record. When you click <span class="CButton">Restore</span>, MainBoss will open a window that lets you examine the contents of the deleted record. If you save the record and close the window, the record will be restored to the <span class="CU">Active</span> list.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Delete.png" alt="Delete" /></span>: Deletes the record that's currently selected.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="PrintHS.png" alt="Print" /></span>: Opens a window to let you print your storeroom assignments. For more information, see <a href="Report.Storeroom%20Assignment.htm">Printing Storeroom Assignments</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Export.png" alt="Export" /></span>: Lets you export data from this table or import data from a file (provided that the file is in an acceptable format). For more information, see <a href="ImportingandExportingDatainTables.htm">Importing and Exporting Data in Tables</a>.

<br /><br />The button has an accompanying drop-down list containing the following:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Export</span>: Exports data in XML format.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Import</span>: Imports data from a properly formatted file.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Save XML Schema</span>: Writes an XML schema for this table into a specified file.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span>: Lets you search through the list of records for a particular record. For more information, see <a href="Search.htm">Searching for a Particular Record</a>. The <span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span> button has an accompanying drop-down list containing the following:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Find Next</span>: Uses the same search condition(s) as your most recent search and finds the next record in the table that matches the condition(s). If the search reaches the end of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the start of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Find Previous</span>: Same as <span class="CButton">Find Next</span> except that it goes backward in the table. If the search reaches the start of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the end of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Defaults for Storeroom Assignments</span> section: Shows any defaults to be used when creating new storeroom assignments.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Edit Defaults</span>: Opens a window to let you change the displayed default values.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
<p><span class="CInset">Other Storage Locations and Assignments:</span> MainBoss also uses several other types of storage locations/assignments:</p>

<ul class="b1"><li><span class="NewTerm">Temporary storage locations</span> are associated with individual work orders. These locations are where you store materials that are going to be used on a particular job. For example, suppose you move a spare part from its usual storeroom to the job site itself; then it's useful to record that the part is now at the job site, so that other workers know it's there and they don't go looking for the part in the storeroom. The temporary storage location is the job site itself (e.g. the location of the unit). Storing the part there is a <span class="NewTerm">temporary storage assignment</span>. (For more on temporary storage locations and assignments, see <a href="Edit.Temporary%20Storage.htm">Temporary Storage Locations</a> and <a href="Edit.Temporary%20Storage%20Assignment.htm">Temporary Storage Assignments</a>.)</li>
<li><span class="NewTerm">Task temporary storage locations</span> are associated with tasks. When the task is used to generate a work order, the task temporary storage location creates a temporary storage location associated with the generated work order. A <span class="NewTerm">task temporary storage assignment</span> corresponds with a temporary storage assignment in a work order. (For more on task temporary storage locations and assignments, see <a href="Edit.Task%20Temporary%20Storage.htm">Editing Task Temporary Storage Locations</a> and <a href="Edit.Task%20Temporary%20Storage%20Assignment.htm">Editing Task Temporary Storage Assignments</a>.)
</li></ul><p>Table viewers for these location and assignment records are similar to the viewers for storage locations and storage assignments. In some cases, you may see windows that let you pick either temporary or permanent storage locations/assignments.</p>
