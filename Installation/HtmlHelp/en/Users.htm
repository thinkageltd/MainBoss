<p>In order for users to access a MainBoss maintenance organization, their authentication credentials must be recorded in the MainBoss database. When a maintenance organization is first created, the only user who can access the organization is the person who originally created the database.</p>

<p class="box">For full details on authorizing users for both MainBoss and SQL Server, see the Installation and Administration Guide.</p>

<p>When setting up user records, you record the SQL server authentication credential for people authorized to use MainBoss. </p>
<p>Note that the Authentication Credential in MainBoss's <span class="CPanel">Users</span> list must be individual SQL credentials; they cannot be groups. In MainBoss, authentication credentials are associated with records in order to create an audit trail. This is why MainBoss itself doesn't accept group authorizations&#8212;an audit should record exactly who made a particular change, which means tracking the individual login name, not just a group name.</p>

<p><span class="CInset">Security Roles:</span> When you create a new user record, it has no associated security roles. This means that new users have no permission to do anything in MainBoss, unless you specifically assign them roles. You must therefore assign each user at least one security role if you expect the person to use MainBoss in any way. For more on security roles, see <a href="SecurityRoles.htm">Security Roles</a>.</p>

<p><span class="CInset">SQL Server Authorization:</span> In order for someone to use MainBoss, the person's login name must be registered in both the MainBoss database and with SQL Server. Only someone with SQL Server Administration privileges can register new users with SQL Server.</p>

<ul class="b1"><li>The easiest scenario for adding new users to MainBoss is if someone with SQL Server Administration privileges does the work. In this case, MainBoss can be used to register each new user in the MainBoss database and with SQL Server.</li>
<li>If the person who adds new users to MainBoss <span class="Emphasis">doesn't</span> have SQL Server Administration privileges, then the process needs two separate steps:
</li></ul><ul class="b2"><li>Registering the new users with MainBoss, as described in <a href="Edit.MainBoss User.htm">Editing MainBoss User Records</a> (which can be done by anyone who's already registered with MainBoss and SQL Server)</li>
<li>Registering the new users with SQL Server, as described in the Installation and Administration Guide (which can only be done by someone with SQL Server Administration privileges)
</li></ul>
<p>(As an alternative two-stage approach, you could create a Windows group named <span class="CU">mainboss</span> in the domain. A SQL Server Administrator could then set up SQL Server permissions so that anyone in the group could access the MainBoss database. Then, whenever someone new needs to be authorized to use MainBoss, a Windows administrator simply adds the new person to the group. Some IT departments may prefer the group approach over authorizing each individual within SQL Server.)</p>
