<p>Various actions change the state of a work order. For example, <span class="CButton">Void</span> changes a work order from the <span class="CPanel">Draft</span> state to the <span class="CPanel">Void</span> state. When you change the state of a work order, MainBoss may open a window where you can record comments about what you're doing. This window also lets you specify the effective date of the change; for example, if you close a work order the day after the job actually finishes, you may want to backdate the state change record to indicate when the job was actually finished.</p>

<p>The editor window normally contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Number</span>: A read-only field identifying the work order whose state is changing.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Current State History State</span>: A read-only field giving the current state of the work order (the state before the intended change).</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Current State History Status</span>: A read-only field giving the current status of the work order. For more on work order statuses, see <a href="WorkOrderStatusCodes.htm">Work Order Status Codes</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Effective Date</span>: The date that you want to associate with the change.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">User Contact</span>: A read-only field identifying the person who created this record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">State</span>: A read-only field giving the state that the work order will enter once you <span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span> this record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Status</span>: A new status code that you want to assign to this work order. Typically, a status code should only be assigned to a work order when the work order needs attention from someone; otherwise, the status should be blank.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Comments</span>: Any comments you want to record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window. This changes the state of the work order.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window <span class="Emphasis">without</span> changing the state of the work order.</p>
