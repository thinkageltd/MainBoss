<p>Each time you generate planned maintenance work orders, MainBoss creates a record describing the generation process. In particular, these records list the work orders that were generated. Such records are called <span class="NewTerm">planned maintenance generation records</span>.</p>

<p>To generate new planned maintenance work orders, you begin by creating a new planned maintenance generation record. For details of the generation process, see <a href="PlannedMaintenance.htm">Planned Maintenance</a>.</p>

<p>To see your planned maintenance generation records (or to create new ones), select <span class="CPanel">Unit Maintenance Plans</span> | <span class="CPanel">Generate Planned Maintenance</span> from the control panel. This opens a window that contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">View</span> section: Shows the list of existing planned maintenance generation records.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Entry Date</span>: The date on which the record was created (which means the date on which work orders were generated).</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">End Date</span>: The date ending the generation period. For example, if you ask MainBoss to generate all planned maintenance jobs that should be done up to and including next Monday, "<span class="CField">End Date</span>" will be the date of next Monday.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Apply Filter</span>: Lets you set up a <span class="NewTerm">filter</span> to select which records should be shown in the table. For more information, see <a href="Filter.htm">Table Filters</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Details</span> section: Shows basic information from the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Generation Details</span> section: Lists information about the generated work orders associated with the selected generation record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Work Orders</span> section: Lists work orders generated in association with the record currently selected in the <span class="CButton">View</span> list.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Errors</span> section: Lists any errors that were discovered in the <span class="CButton">Commit</span> process of the selected generation record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">New Planned Maintenance Batch</span>: Opens a window that will let you generate new planned maintenance work orders. This window is described in <a href="Edit.Planned%20Maintenance%20Batch.htm">Editing Planned Maintenance Generation Records</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Change Schedule Basis</span>: Opens a window to let you set the schedule basis for a unit maintenance plan(s). The schedule basis is when the clock starts ticking for future planned maintenance jobs&#8212;typically the date or meter reading for the most recent such job done on the unit. For more, see <a href="Edit.Scheduling%20Basis.htm">Specifying a Schedule Basis</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Edit.png" alt="Edit" /></span>: This drop-down button offers several possible actions:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Edit</span>: Opens an editor window to let you edit the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">View</span>: Opens an editor window where you can examine the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span>: Lets you search through the list of records for a particular record. For more information, see <a href="Search.htm">Searching for a Particular Record</a>. The <span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span> button has an accompanying drop-down list containing the following:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Find Next</span>: Uses the same search condition(s) as your most recent search and finds the next record in the table that matches the condition(s). If the search reaches the end of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the start of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Find Previous</span>: Same as <span class="CButton">Find Next</span> except that it goes backward in the table. If the search reaches the start of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the end of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Defaults for Planned Maintenance Batches</span> section: Shows any defaults to be used when creating new unit maintenance plans.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Edit Defaults</span>: Opens a window to let you change the current default values.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
<p class="box"><span class="CInset">Note:</span> You use the <span class="CButton">Defaults for Planned Maintenance Batches</span> section to set the generation interval for your planned maintenance scheduling. For more details, see <a href="PlannedMaintenance.htm">Planned Maintenance</a>.</p>
