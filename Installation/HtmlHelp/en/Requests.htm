<p>Requests (often called work requests, abbreviated to W/R) make it easy for non-specialized staff to capture the essentials of a reported problem originating from outside the maintenance department. The information can even be entered into the computer during a phone call with a complainant.</p>

<p class="box"><span class="CInset">Basic Principle:</span> A Request is a simple way for someone to write down information about a complaint. Even if the person who takes the complaint doesn't know a lot about your maintenance policies, the Request form guides the person to record information that maintenance personnel will need later on. A maintenance manager can turn a basic Request into a real Work Order, and then finish off the Work Order by adding more information (who's assigned to do the work, when the job should be done, and so on).</p>

<p>For information on viewing work requests, see <a href="Browse.Request.htm">Viewing Requests</a>. For information on creating and editing work requests, see <a href="Edit.Request.htm">Editing Requests</a>. For information on printing work requests, see <a href="Report.Request.htm">Printing Requests</a>.</p>

<p><span class="CInset">Request States:</span><span class="CInset"> </span>Requests can be described as any of the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CPanel">New</span>: A new request has just been created and has not been processed in any other way.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CPanel">In Progress</span>: A request is <span class="NewTerm">in progress</span> when someone has clicked the <span class="CButton">In Progress</span> button for the request. Typically, this is done when someone notices that the request has come in and begins to take action on the request. Clicking <span class="CButton">In Progress</span> basically means, "We've seen this and we've started working on it."</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CPanel">Open</span>: A request is <span class="NewTerm">open</span> if it's new, in progress, or transferred.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CPanel">Closed</span>: You <span class="NewTerm">close</span> a request once the work has been done. You do so by clicking the <span class="CButton">Close</span> button. Requests are also considered closed if they are canceled by clicking <span class="CButton">Void</span>. However, a voided request can never be reopened&#8212;once it's canceled, it's canceled permanently.</p>
