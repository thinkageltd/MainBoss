<p>An expense model mapping says that a particular expense category is allowed within the expense model. For more on expense models and expense categories, see <a href="AccountingFacilities.htm">Accounting Facilities</a>.</p>

<p>There are several ways to create a new mapping. For example, you can click <span class="CButton">New Expense Mapping</span> in the <span class="CButton">Expense Mappings</span> section of an expense model record. You can also click <span class="CButton">New Expense Mapping</span> in the <span class="CButton">Expense Mappings</span> section of an expense category record. Either way, you get a window that contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Model</span>: The expense model in which the mapping will be allowed. If you got to this window from an expense model record, this field will be read-only (giving the name of the expense model record). For more on expense models, see <a href="ExpenseModels.htm">Expense Models</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Category</span>: An expense category which will be allowed in the expense model. If you got to this window from an expense category record, this field will be read-only (giving the name of the expense category record). For more on expense categories, see <a href="ExpenseCategories.htm">Expense Categories</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Valid for Items</span>, <span class="CButton">Valid for Hourly Inside, Hourly Outside, Per Job Inside, Per Job Outside</span>, <span class="CButton">Valid for Miscellaneous Costs</span>: These checkboxes indicate what uses are valid for the chosen "<span class="CField">Category</span>". The checkboxes are read-only; to allow different uses of the expense category, you must edit the expense category record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Cost Center</span>: The cost center to be associated with this expense category in this expense model. For more on cost centers, see <a href="CostCenters.htm">Cost Centers</a>. (The "<span class="CField">Cost Center</span>" field is only visible if your database has an <span class="BL">Accounting</span> module license key.)</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
