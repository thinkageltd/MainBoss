<p>You create or modify per job outside records using the per job outside editor. The usual way to open the editor is to click <span class="CButton">New Per Job Outside</span> or <span class="CButton">Edit</span> in the <span class="CButton">View</span> section of <span class="CPanel">Coding Definitions</span> | <span class="CPanel">Work Orders</span> | <span class="CPanel">Labor</span> | <span class="CPanel">Per Job Outside</span>.</p>

<p>The per job outside editor window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Details</span> section: Lists basic information about the record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Code</span>: A brief code to identify this record. No two records may have the same code.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Description</span>: A description of the job associated with this record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Vendor</span>: The outside contractor you hire to do this job.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Trade</span>: A trade classification for the contractor. This trade should already exist in your trades table. For more information, see <a href="Trades.htm">Trades</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Order Line Text</span>: What should be written on a purchase order when ordering per job work from this contractor.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Cost</span>: The cost charged by the contractor.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Vendor Accounts Payable Cost Center</span>: A read-only field giving the cost center to which this labor expense should be charged. This information is taken from the vendor record. For more on cost centers, see <a href="CostCenters.htm">Cost Centers</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Comments</span>: Any comments you want to associate with this record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Task Demand Per Job Outside</span> section: Lists tasks that include a demand that involves this hourly outside record. For more information, see <a href="Tasks.htm">Tasks</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
