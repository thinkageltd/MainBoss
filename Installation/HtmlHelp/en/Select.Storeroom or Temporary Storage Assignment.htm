<p>In a work order, a temporary storage assignment specifies an item that will be stored in a temporary storage location associated with the work order. Typically, you specify the temporary storage location first (as described in <a href="Edit.Temporary%20Storage.htm">Temporary Storage Locations</a>) and then you specify the item(s) to be kept in that location.</p>

<p>There are several ways to create a temporary storage assignment:</p>

<ul class="b1"><li>Go to the <span class="CButton">Resources</span> section of a work order. In the <span class="CButton">Items</span> subsection, drop the arrow on <span class="CButton">New Temporary Storage</span> and click <span class="CButton">New Temporary Storage Assignment</span>.</li>
<li>In a storeroom record, go to the <span class="CButton">Temporary Storage Assignment</span> section and click <span class="CButton">New Temporary Storage Assignment</span>.
</li></ul><p>In all of the above cases, MainBoss opens a window that contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Details</span> section: Shows basic information for the record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Work Order</span>: A read-only field giving the work order associated with this temporary storage assignment.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Item</span>: The item that will be stored in the temporary storage location.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Location</span>: A temporary storage location associated with this work order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Item Price</span>: A price or price quote on the item. Typically, this is used to indicate the vendor from whom you prefer to purchase the item. For more on item pricing, see <a href="Edit.Item%20Pricing.htm">Item Pricing</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2">Read-only fields: Information on quantities of the specified item which are already in the given location.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Cost Center</span> (only visible if your database has an <span class="BL">Accounting</span> license key): The cost center to be used for any costs associated with holding this item at this location. For more on cost centers, see <a href="CostCenters.htm">Cost Centers</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Item Activity</span> section: Information about changes in the item at this location. For example, you could use entries in the activity section to record the transfer of items to and from the temporary storage location.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">New Item Adjustment</span>: Adds or subtracts a quantity of the given item from the temporary storage location. For more, see <a href="Edit.Item%20Adjustment.htm">Making Item Adjustments</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">New Item Issue</span>: Issues a quantity of the given item from the temporary storage location. For more, see <a href="Edit.Item%20Issue.htm">Issuing Items</a>. This button contains the following in its drop-down list:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">New Item Transfer To</span>: Transfers this type of item from this temporary storage to some other location. For more, see <a href="Edit.Item%20Transfer.htm">Transferring Items from One Storeroom to Another</a>.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">New Item Transfer From</span>: Transfers this type of item from some other location to this temporary storage. For more, see <a href="Edit.Item%20Transfer.htm">Transferring Items from One Storeroom to Another</a>.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">New Receive Item (with PO)</span>: Records the receipt of an item that appears on a purchase order. For more information, see <a href="Edit.Receive%20Item%20(with%20PO).htm">Receiving Purchase Order Items</a>.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">New Receive Item</span>: Opens a window where you can record the receipt of this type of item into inventory. This window is described in <a href="Edit.Receive%20Item%20(no%20PO).htm">Receiving Items</a>.

<br /><br />A typical scenario is when you use petty cash to buy items for use on a job (e.g. paint, glue, tape, etc.). In order to track all your maintenance expenses, you should record the purchase as part of the work order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Correct</span>: Makes a correction to an existing entry.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Edit.png" alt="Edit" /></span>: This drop-down button offers several possible actions:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Edit</span>: Opens an editor window to let you edit the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">View</span>: Opens an editor window where you can examine the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span>: Lets you search through the list of records for a particular record. For more information, see <a href="Search.htm">Searching for a Particular Record</a>. The <span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span> button has an accompanying drop-down list containing the following:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Find Next</span>: Uses the same search condition(s) as your most recent search and finds the next record in the table that matches the condition(s). If the search reaches the end of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the start of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Find Previous</span>: Same as <span class="CButton">Find Next</span> except that it goes backward in the table. If the search reaches the start of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the end of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect recent changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
