<p>Some editors have a <span class="CButton">Correct</span> button. <span class="CButton">Correct</span> is used to make corrections to information that has already generated accounting transactions (e.g. records of actual costs on work orders). To maintain an accurate audit trail, MainBoss doesn't let you change or delete existing accounting records. Instead, you have to create new <span class="NewTerm">correction</span> records which add or subtract from previous monetary values.</p>

<p>On a similar principle, <span class="NewTerm">physical count</span> records resulting from taking inventory can't have their numbers altered once the record is saved. Instead, you have to <span class="NewTerm">void</span> (cancel) a physical count, then record a new count. Again, the point is to prevent numbers from being fudged&#8212;you always leave an audit trail.</p>
