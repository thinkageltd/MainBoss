<p>The Average Request Duration Per Grouping chart provides one or more charts showing the average duration of requests. The options you specify in the <span class="CButton">Grouping</span> section of the report window will dictate what charts actually appear in the report.</p>

<p>The average duration is based on MainBoss's best guess at the actual duration of each request involved. The actual duration is calculated as the request's actual end date minus the date that the request was first marked as <span class="CButton">In Progress</span>. The actual end date is calculated as follows:</p>

<ol><li>If a request has ever been closed or voided, the actual end date is taken to be the effective date of the last time the request was closed or voided.</li>
<li>If the request has never been closed or voided, the actual end date will be taken as the "<span class="CField">Estimated Completion Date</span>" from the most recent state history record that actually has such a date. If no history record has a "<span class="CField">Estimated Completion Date</span>", the actual end date is taken as today.
</li></ol><p>You obtain the chart with <span class="CPanel">Requests</span> | <span class="CPanel">Charts</span> | <span class="CPanel">Average Request Duration Per Grouping</span>. The resulting window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Grouping</span> section: Options controlling what charts actually appear in the report. You must specify at least one grouping option to have any charts appear.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Sorting</span> section: Options controlling how the bars are sorted within bar-chart.</p>
<p class="box">For more on how to use <span class="CButton">Grouping</span> and <span class="CButton">Sorting</span>, see <a href="ReportSections.htm">Report Sections</a>.</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Filters</span> section: Options controlling which requests will be included in the charts. For more information, see <a href="ReportFilter.htm">Report Filters</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Include Inactive records</span>: If this checkbox is checkmarked, all relevant records will be included in the report, no matter how old they are. If this checkbox is blank, only active records will be included; this means that old "inactive" records will be ignored.

<br /><br />For more about the active filter, see <a href="Edit.Active%20Filter.htm">The Active Filter</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Field Selection</span> section: Options controlling which information fields will be included in the report.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Suppress Costs</span>: Omits any money information that might otherwise be displayed in the charts.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Advanced</span> section: Miscellaneous options.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Report width in pages</span>: Makes it possible to have lines that are wider than a single page. This is particularly useful when you are previewing reports on a monitor screen. For further information, see <a href="ReportSections.htm">Report Sections</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Title</span>: The title to be printed at the beginning of the report.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Main Font</span>: The font that will be used for most of the characters in the report. This should be a font that is supported by both your Windows system and your printer.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Fixed-width Font</span>: The font that will be used for information that is printed with fixed-width characters (mostly unit specifications). This should be a font that is supported by both your Windows system and your printer.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Chart Axis Interval</span>: Specifies the units for measuring request duration. For example, if you specify <span class="CButton">Days</span>, the charts will be based on how many days each request took.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Show Summary charts for each group</span>: If this box is checkmarked, the report will include summaries for each group. For example, if the report is grouped by unit, then there'll be summary information for each unit.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Show Summary charts for the report</span>: If this box is checkmarked, the report will have a summary covering all the information in the report.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Preview</span> section: Displays a visual preview of the report. If you click the <span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span> button, you automatically go to this section.

<br /><br />The <span class="CButton">Preview</span> section contains buttons for looking through the report preview and for actually printing the information. For more on using the <span class="CButton">Preview</span> section, see <a href="ReportButtons.htm">Report Buttons</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="PrintHS.png" alt="Print" /></span>: Immediately prints the report.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Export Data</span>: Exports the report's data in XML format.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Cancels the preparation and printing of a report. This button is enabled only when MainBoss is preparing a report, i.e. gathering the data and formatting it. For more information, see <a href="ReportButtons.htm">Report Buttons</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Clicking this button generates a preview of the report, displayed in the <span class="CButton">Preview</span> section of the window.</p>
