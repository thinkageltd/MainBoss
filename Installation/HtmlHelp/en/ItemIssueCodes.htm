<p>Item Issue Codes specify reasons for issuing items from your inventory. The most common case, of course, is when an item is issued for use on a work order. However, there are other situations in which you may issue materials from your inventory. For example, a rental management company might issue inventory items directly to tenants for simple jobs that the tenants can do on their own (e.g. changing light bulbs). You might also remove materials from inventory in this way if they are being given to another department.</p>

<p>Here are some sample issue codes:</p>

<pre>Purchased by tenant
Transferred to other department</pre>

<p>In order to use issue codes, you must create an issue record. For more, see <a href="Edit.Item%20Issue.htm">Issuing Items</a>.</p>

<p><span class="CInset">Adjustment Codes vs. Issue Codes:</span> There's no clear dividing line between item issues and item adjustments&#8212;it's up to you when to describe something as an issue and when to describe it as an adjustment. However, we suggest the following principle: call it an issue when you expect that the item will actually be used (perhaps by a tenant or another department), and otherwise call it an adjustment. For example, if you give a tenant some spare light bulbs to use when needed, that's an issue; if you break a light bulb, write it up with an adjustment.</p>

<p>(Note that adjustments can either add or subtract from the stock on hand, while issues always subtract.)</p>
