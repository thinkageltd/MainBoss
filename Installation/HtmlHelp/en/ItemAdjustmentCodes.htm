<p>From time to time, you may find it necessary to adjust MainBoss's inventory records. For example, when you take a physical inventory, you may need to change MainBoss's counts of how much stock you have on hand for some items. As another example, when you move items from one storeroom to another, you should record the transfer so that MainBoss's records continue to be an accurate reflection of what each storeroom contains. Your organization may have a number of other common situations where inventory levels need to be adjusted.</p>

<p>Some types of adjustments (such as changing the value of inventory items) have specific entries in the MainBoss menu; other types must be handled as a <span class="NewTerm">miscellaneous</span> adjustment. With these miscellaneous types of adjustments, MainBoss asks you to specify an <span class="NewTerm">adjustment code</span> that tells why the adjustment was required. Here are some sample adjustment codes:</p>

<pre>Breakage
Theft
Transferred to other department
Physical count adjustment</pre>

<p>By assigning adjustment codes to adjustments, you can track special adjustments and calculate their cost to your organization.</p>
