<p>The Work Order Resource Demand report displays information about all resource demands used in work orders. For example, you can obtain a report on all the work orders that contained a demand for particular worker (either hourly inside or per job inside labor).</p>

<p>Note that there are also reports for each type of demand that can be used in a work order. For example, there's a report that's specifically about item demands used in a work order. The specific reports provide more selective options than the "all resources" report. For example, you can group the Work Order Items report by item category; you can't group the "All Resources" report by item category, since that doesn't make sense for other types of resources (e.g. hourly inside).</p>

<p>The specific resources reports are:</p>

<ul class="b1"><li>The Work Order Items Demand report (<a href="Report.Work Order Item.htm">Work Order Items Report</a>)</li>
<li>The Work Order Hourly Inside Demand report (<a href="Report.Work Order Hourly Inside.htm">Work Order Hourly Inside Report</a>)</li>
<li>The Work Order Per Job Inside Demand report (<a href="Report.Work Order Per Job Inside.htm">Work Order Per Job Inside Report</a>)</li>
<li>The Work Order Hourly Outside Demand report (<a href="Report.Work Order Hourly Outside.htm">Work Order Hourly Outside Report</a>)</li>
<li>The Work Order Per Job Outside Demand report (<a href="Report.Work Order Per Job Outside.htm">Work Order Per Job Outside Report</a>)</li>
<li>The Work Order Miscellaneous Expense Demand Report (<a href="Report.Work Order Miscellaneous Expense.htm">Work Order Miscellaneous Expenses Report</a>)
</li></ul>
<p class="box">MainBoss also has reports about actual report use, corresponding to the given reports about demands. For more information, see <a href="WorkOrderResourceActualReports.htm">Work Order Resource Actual Reports</a>.</p>

<p>You obtain the report with <span class="CPanel">Work Orders</span> | <span class="CPanel">Reports</span> | <span class="CPanel">Work Order Resource Demand</span>. The resulting window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Grouping</span> section: Options controlling how the report is broken into sections and sub-sections.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Show summary footer for the overall report</span>: If this box is checkmarked, the report will include a final line summarizing information from the entire report. If the box is blank, no such line will be included.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Sorting</span> section: Options controlling how records are sorted within each section and sub-section.</p>
<p class="box">For more on how to use <span class="CButton">Grouping</span> and <span class="CButton">Sorting</span>, see <a href="ReportSections.htm">Report Sections</a>.</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Filters</span> section: Options controlling what kind of work orders will be included in the report. For more information, see <a href="ReportFilter.htm">Report Filters</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Include Inactive records</span>: If this checkbox is checkmarked, all relevant records will be included in the report, no matter how old they are. If this checkbox is blank, only active records will be included; this means that old "inactive" records will be ignored.

<br /><br />For more about the active filter, see <a href="Edit.Active Filter.htm">The Active Filter</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Field Selection</span> section: Options controlling which information fields will be included in the report.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Suppress Costs</span>: Omits any money information that might otherwise be displayed in the report.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Advanced</span> section: Miscellaneous options.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Format Report in Columns</span>: If this checkbox is checkmarked, the report will have information formatted in columns; this has the advantage of compressing a lot of information into a small amount of space, but may be difficult to read, especially if you ask for many pieces of information to be displayed. If the checkbox is blank, information will be laid out in a less rigid format.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Summary Format</span>: If this checkbox is checkmarked, the report is essentially a summary of the summary. You don't see information on individual work orders; instead, you get a summary of all work orders in a particular group, as dictated by the options specified in the <span class="CButton">Grouping</span> section. For example, if you are grouping by <span class="CButton">Work Category</span>, you will get a summary for each category.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Report width in pages</span>: Makes it possible to have lines that are wider than a single page. This is particularly useful when you are previewing reports on a monitor screen. For further information, see <a href="ReportSections.htm">Report Sections</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Title</span>: The title to be printed at the beginning of the report.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Main Font</span>: The font that will be used for most of the characters in the report. This should be a font that is supported by both your Windows system and your printer.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Fixed-width Font</span>: The font that will be used for information that is printed with fixed-width characters (mostly unit specifications). This should be a font that is supported by both your Windows system and your printer.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Preview</span> section: Displays a visual preview of the report. If you click the <span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span> button, you automatically go to this section.

<br /><br />The <span class="CButton">Preview</span> section contains buttons for looking through the report preview and for actually printing the information. For more on using the <span class="CButton">Preview</span> section, see <a href="ReportButtons.htm">Report Buttons</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="PrintHS.png" alt="Print" /></span>: Immediately prints the report.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Export Data</span>: Exports the report's data in XML format.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Cancels the preparation and printing of a report. This button is enabled only when MainBoss is preparing a report, i.e. gathering the data and formatting it. For more information, see <a href="ReportButtons.htm">Report Buttons</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Clicking this button generates a preview of the report, displayed in the <span class="CButton">Preview</span> section of the window.</p>
