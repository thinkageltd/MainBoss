<p>The Work Order by Assignee report prints full work orders grouped by assignee. For example, suppose you have workers named A, B and C who are all assignees to work orders. The report would print out all of A's work orders, then all of B's, then all of C's. This makes it easy to print off your workers' assigned work orders in batches, so that each worker gets a copy of his or her work orders.</p>

<p>If a work order has more than one assignee, the work order will be printed multiple times, once for each corresponding assignee.</p>

<p>To print a Work Order by Assignee report, use <span class="CPanel">Work Orders</span> | <span class="CPanel">Reports</span> | <span class="CPanel">Work Orders by Assignee</span>. This opens a window that contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Grouping</span> section: Options controlling how the report is broken into sections and sub-sections.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Sorting</span> section: Options controlling how records are sorted within each section and sub-section.</p>
<p class="box">For more on how to use <span class="CButton">Grouping</span> and <span class="CButton">Sorting</span>, see <a href="ReportSections.htm">Report Sections</a>.</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Filters</span> section: Options controlling what kind of work orders will be included in the report. For more information, see <a href="ReportFilter.htm">Report Filters</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Include Inactive records</span>: If this checkbox is checkmarked, all relevant records will be included in the report, no matter how old they are. If this checkbox is blank, only active records will be included; this means that old "inactive" records will be ignored.

<br /><br />For more about the active filter, see <a href="Edit.Active%20Filter.htm">The Active Filter</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Field Selection</span> section: Options controlling which information fields will be included in the report.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Suppress Costs</span>: Omits any money information that might otherwise be displayed in the report.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Advanced</span> section: Miscellaneous options.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Report width in pages</span>: Makes it possible to have lines that are wider than a single page. This is particularly useful when you are previewing reports on a monitor screen. For further information, see <a href="ReportSections.htm">Report Sections</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Title</span>: The title to be printed at the beginning of the report.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Main Font</span>: The font that will be used for most of the characters in the report. This should be a font that is supported by both your Windows system and your printer.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Fixed-width Font</span>: The font that will be used for information that is printed with fixed-width characters (mostly unit specifications). This should be a font that is supported by both your Windows system and your printer.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Bar Code Symbology</span>: Specifies a format to be used for printing bar codes in this report. If you choose <span class="CButton">None</span>, no bar codes will be printed; otherwise, a bar code containing the work order number will be printed for every work order in the report. For more information, see <a href="BarCodeSupport.htm">Bar Code Support</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Additional blank lines</span>: May be filled in with a number. If so, MainBoss will add that number of blank lines in the labor/material section of the work order. Workers can write in this blank area to record labor and/or materials not included in the original work report (e.g. materials you didn't expect to need).</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Additional information</span>: Extra information to be printed in the work orders. For example, you can use this area to specify that work orders should contain a signature line where customers can sign off once the job is finished.

<br /><br />You can set the default text for this additional information by using the <span class="CPanel">Work Orders</span> table viewer. Go to the <span class="CButton">Defaults for Work Orders</span> section and then to <span class="CButton">Printed Form</span>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Preview</span> section: Displays a visual preview of the report. If you click the <span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span> button, you automatically go to this section.

<br /><br />The <span class="CButton">Preview</span> section contains buttons for looking through the report preview and for actually printing the information. For more on using the <span class="CButton">Preview</span> section, see <a href="ReportButtons.htm">Report Buttons</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="PrintHS.png" alt="Print" /></span>: Immediately prints the report.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Export Data</span>: Exports the report's data in XML format.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Cancels the preparation and printing of a report. This button is enabled only when MainBoss is preparing a report, i.e. gathering the data and formatting it. For more information, see <a href="ReportButtons.htm">Report Buttons</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Clicking this button generates a preview of the report, displayed in the <span class="CButton">Preview</span> section of the window.</p>
