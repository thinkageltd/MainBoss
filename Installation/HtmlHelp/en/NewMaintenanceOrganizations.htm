<p>You can create a new maintenance organization database by clicking <span class="CButton">Create New Organization</span> in the Maintenance Organization window (see <a href="Browse.Organization.htm">Your Maintenance Organization List</a>). This action requires SQL Server Administration privileges.</p>

<p>When you click <span class="CButton">Create New Organization</span>, MainBoss opens a window where you can specify information about the new organization:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Database Server</span>: The network location of the SQL Server through which you will access the database. For more information, see the <a href=" " >Installation and Administration Guide</a>.

<br /><br />If you click the accompanying "..." button, MainBoss displays a list of database servers that are known to your Windows system. There may be additional servers that you can use but that Windows doesn't currently know about. For more, see <a href="Browse.SQL Server.htm">The Database Server List</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Database Name</span>: The name you want SQL Server to give to the new database. This name must be different from the names of any other databases on the server. For example, you can't name every database "MainBoss". If you want to see what MainBoss databases already exist, click the "..." button at the end of the "<span class="CField">Database Name</span>" line. (For more, see <a href="Browse.SQL Database.htm">The Database Name List</a>.)

<br /><br />"<span class="CField">Database Name</span>" must obey SQL Server's rules for database names. In particular, the name can't contain spaces or special punctuation characters.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Organization Name</span>: A name that you will use for this database. The value of "<span class="CField">Organization Name</span>" may contain spaces and other punctuation characters.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Make browsers smaller by not showing details for selected record by default</span>: If you checkmark this box, MainBoss will automatically hide the details panel when displaying tables in this database. For more, see <a href="HidingtheDetailsforaSelectedRecord.htm">Hiding the Details for a Selected Record</a>. Note that you can still ask MainBoss to display the details panel for a particular table by pressing the button for displaying details.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Preferred Mode</span>: The default mode in which this database should be opened. If you do not specify a mode explicitly, the database will be opened in the given mode. For more on modes, see <a href="Browse.Organization.htm">Your Maintenance Organization List</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">OK</span>: MainBoss attempts to create a new maintenance organization database with the name you specified. You must have appropriate permissions to create this database.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without creating a database.</p>
<p>When you create a new database in this way, the "<span class="CField">Organization Name</span>" that you specify becomes that database's default organization name. When other people use <span class="CButton">Add Existing Organization</span> to add that database to their list, they'll automatically inherit this default name. However, users can then use <span class="CButton">Edit Organization</span> to assign a different "<span class="CField">Organization Name</span>" to the database. If a user does this, the new name is considered that user's personal name for the database&#8212;a name for that single user's convenience. When a user changes a personal "<span class="CField">Organization Name</span>", it has no effect on other users; it doesn't change the name/address printed on requests, work orders and purchase orders, nor does it change the default "<span class="CField">Organization Name</span>" when users add the database to their list of known organizations.</p>

<p>In order to use a new database, it must have license keys. You must record your license keys before you can proceed to use MainBoss. After creating a new database, MainBoss automatically opens in <span class="CPanel">Administration</span> mode to let you enter the keys. Follow the steps in <a href="LicenseKeys.htm">License Keys</a> to enter your license keys. Then quit MainBoss and start again for the keys to become active.</p>

<p class="box">When someone creates a new database, MainBoss always gives that person the <span class="CU">Administration</span> security role for the database.</p>
