<p>You create or modify task records using the task editor. The usual way to open the editor is to click <span class="CButton">New Task</span> or <span class="CButton">Edit</span> in the <span class="CButton">View</span> section of <span class="CPanel">Unit Maintenance Plans</span> | <span class="CPanel">Tasks</span> or <span class="CPanel">Coding Definitions</span> | <span class="CPanel">Unit Maintenance Plans</span> | <span class="CPanel">Tasks</span>.</p>

<p>The task editor window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Details</span> section: Shows basic information for the record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Code</span>: A brief code to identify this task. No two tasks may have the same code.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Description</span>: A longer description of the task.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Subject</span>: A subject line to be used for work orders generated from this task. For more on work orders, see <a href="WorkOrders.htm">Work Orders</a>.</p>
<p class="box"><span class="CInset">Note:</span> The "<span class="CField">Subject</span>" field is not mandatory in a task record, but it <span class="Emphasis">is</span> required in work orders. If you attempt to generate a work order from a task that doesn't have a "<span class="CField">Subject</span>", you will receive a message saying, "No value is supplied for required field SUBJECT". (A similar message is generated if the task omits some other required field.) Therefore, we recommend that all your tasks have "<span class="CField">Subject</span>" lines.</p>

<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Containing Task</span>: Used when this task should be a specialization of another task. If so, set the field to the name of the containing task. For more on task specializations, see <a href="TaskSpecializations.htm">Task Specializations</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Work Duration</span>: The number of days that the task is expected to take.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CField">This Task</span>: For a task, this should specify the number of days that this task is expected to take. For a task specialization, this should specify the number of <span class="Emphasis">additional</span> days this specialization is expected to take, over and above the task on which this specialization is based.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CField">Basis Task</span>: For a task, this is blank and read-only. For a task specialization, this is a read-only field giving the duration of the task on which this specialization is based.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CField">Effective values</span>: The total duration expected for this task, calculated by adding the values in "<span class="CField">This Task</span>" and "<span class="CField">Basis Task</span>".</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Generate Lead Time</span>: Is specified as a number of days. If you enter a number in this field, work orders using this task will be generated the given number of days earlier than they would be otherwise. For example, if the value is 7, work orders using this task will be generated a week earlier than normal. (The "<span class="CField">Work Start Date</span>" in the generated work order will tell when the job should actually start.)

<br /><br />By specifying a lead time, you create a delay between the time a work order is created and the time the job actually begins. This allows you time to make preparations. A lead time is particularly useful if you need to buy parts especially for a job. When MainBoss generates a work order, it immediately creates demands for all items required for the job; if some of these items aren't in stock, they'll show up on the <span class="CPanel">Item Restocking</span> report. In this way, you'll see ahead of time that you need to order the parts. If you set enough lead time, the parts will be in by the time you actually have to do the work.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CField">This Task</span>: For a task, this should specify the number of days of lead time this task needs. For a task specialization, this should specify the number of <span class="Emphasis">additional</span> days of lead time this specialization needs, over and above the task on which this specialization is based.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CField">Basis Task</span>: For a task, this is blank and read-only. For a task specialization, this is a read-only field giving the lead time of the task on which this specialization is based.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CField">Effective values</span>: The total lead time expected for this task, calculated by adding the values in "<span class="CField">This Task</span>" and "<span class="CField">Basis Task</span>".</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Work Category</span>: The type of work involved in this task. For more on work categories, see <a href="WorkCategories.htm">Work Categories</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Access Code</span>: An access code to be associated with work orders generated from this task. For more on access codes, see <a href="AccessCodes.htm">Access Codes</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Priority</span>: A priority to be associated with work orders generated from this task. For more on such priorities, see <a href="WorkOrderPriorities.htm">Work Order Priorities</a>.+</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Expense Model</span>: The expense model to be associated with work orders generated from this task. For more on expense models, see <a href="ExpenseModels.htm">Expense Models</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Project</span>: A project to be associated with this task (if any). For more on projects, see <a href="Projects.htm">Projects</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Work Description</span>: A description of the work to be done in this task. You should enter step-by-step instructions or a checklist of things to be done during this planned maintenance job. You should also enter any other information that workers might find useful, e.g. the tools that will be needed or tips on dealing with special problems.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Downtime</span>: A default downtime&#8212;how long the unit is expected to be down during the maintenance.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Close Code</span>: A default closing code to be assigned to work orders generated from this task. For more on closing codes, see <a href="ClosingCodes.htm">Closing Codes</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Closing Comment</span>: Any comment that should be filled into the <span class="CField">Closing Comment</span> section of generated work orders.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Comments</span>: Comments about this task record. These comments will <span class="Emphasis">not</span> appear on generated work orders.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Select for Printing</span>: If this box is checkmarked, work orders generated from this task will be marked <span class="CButton">Select for Printing</span>. This makes it simpler to print the work orders after they have been generated. For more on the use of <span class="CButton">Select for Printing</span>, see <a href="SelectPrintFlags.htm">Select Print Flags</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Task Resources</span> section: May specify materials that should be reserved for the task. This section may also assign inside workers or outside contractors to the task. Note that these are <span class="Emphasis">default</span> assignments to be used when work orders are generated from the task description. Such assignments may be changed on the actual generated work order. (For example, if a job is usually done by worker X but that person is on vacation, you can edit a generated work order to assign the job to someone else.)</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Demand Count</span>: A read-only field giving the total number of demands current specified for the task.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Task Items</span> section: Specifies items to be demanded by the task. The list shows current demands; the buttons let you add new demands and temporary storage assignments.</p>
