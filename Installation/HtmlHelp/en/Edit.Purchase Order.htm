<p>A purchase order lists goods and/or services that you wish to purchase from a vendor. It can also list information such as where purchased items should be stored when they're received and the payment terms for the order.</p>

<p>To create a purchase order, go to <span class="CPanel">Purchase Orders</span> and click the <span class="CButton">New Purchase Order</span> button. This opens a window that contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Details</span> section: Basic information about the purchase order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Number</span>: An identification number to label this purchase order. No two purchase orders may have the same code.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Number Format</span> [only appears when editing defaults]: Specifies the format to be used when numbering new purchase orders. The default is <span class="CU">PO {0:D8}</span>. This means that the numbering format consists of the letters <span class="CU">PO</span> followed by a space and then eight decimal digits.

<br /><br />The <span class="CU">0</span> before the <span class="CU">:</span> is necessary. The number after the <span class="CU">D</span> is the minimum number of decimal digits in the resulting number. As an example, suppose you want to include the year in purchase orders numbers. If you set "<span class="CField">Number Format</span>" to <span class="CU">PO 2007-{0:D6}</span>, you'll get numbers like <span class="CU">PO 2007-000001</span>. You can also put text after the closing <span class="CU">}</span>; for example, you could write <span class="CU">PO {0:D6}-2007 </span>to get numbers like <span class="CU">PO 000001-2007</span>.

<br /><br />For more on number formats, see <a href="NumberFormats.htm">Number Formats</a>.</p>
<p class="box">We recommend that you use enough digits in your numbers to ensure that there is always a leading zero.</p>

<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Number Sequence</span> [only appears when editing defaults]: Specifies the number to used the next time you create a new purchase order. For example, if you set this to 1000, the next purchase order you create will be given the number 1000.</p>
<p class="box">If you include the year in "<span class="CField">Number Format</span>", you should change the format at the beginning of each year and reset "<span class="CField">Number Sequence</span>" to 1.</p>

<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Send Invoice To</span> [only appears when editing defaults]: Specifies a contact person within your organization to whom invoices should be sent. To fill in this field, you specify an entry in your <span class="CPanel">Contacts</span> table. For more on contacts, see <a href="Contacts.htm">Contacts</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Summary</span>: A summary describing the nature of the purchase order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Details</span>: Read-only fields indicating the purchase order's current status.</p>

<p class="wi3"><span class="CField">State</span>: Whether the purchase order is Draft (recently created), Open (ready to be sent to the vendor), Void (cancelled), or Closed (marked as complete). A new purchase order's "<span class="CField">State</span>" is blank until the first time the purchase order is saved.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CField">Status</span>: A user-defined status code for this purchase order. Typically, a code means that the purchase order requires someone's attention. For more on purchase order status codes, see <a href="PurchaseOrderStatusCodes.htm">Purchase Order Status Codes</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Required By Date</span>: The date by which you expect this PO to be filled (i.e. when the goods/services will be delivered).</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Vendor</span>: The supplier or contractor who'll supply the goods and services. For more on vendors, see <a href="Vendors.htm">Vendors</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Purchase Order Category</span>: A category for this purchase order. For more on purchase order categories, see <a href="PurchaseOrderCategories.htm">Purchase Order Categories</a> on page 174.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Use payment terms from vendor</span>: If you checkmark this box, MainBoss will set the "<span class="CField">Payment Terms</span>" field to the default payment terms associated with the given vendor (if any). If you leave the box blank, you can set "<span class="CField">Payment Terms</span>" manually.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Payment Term</span>: The terms on which you intend to pay for the goods/services. For more on payment terms, see <a href="PaymentTerms.htm">Payment Terms</a>.</p>

<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Project</span>: A project that should be associated with this purchase order template. For more on projects, see <a href="Projects.htm">Projects</a> on page 405.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Comment to Vendor</span>: Any comments that should be printed on the purchase order when it is issued to the vendor.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Comments</span>: Any internal comments you want to record on the purchase order. These will <span class="Emphasis">not</span> be printed on the purchase order when it's issued.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Select for Printing</span>: Makes it simpler to print the purchase order after it has been created. For more on the use of <span class="CButton">Select for Printing</span>, see <a href="SelectPrintFlags.htm">Select Print Flags</a>.</p>

<p class="box"><span class="CInset">Note:</span> If you change the text in the <span class="CButton">Printed Form</span> section, it does <span class="Emphasis">not</span> change the text in any customizations you have saved previously. Customizations save their own copies of the <span class="CButton">Printed Form</span> information, and these copies are independent of any changes you make later in the main defaults. This can be confusing&#8212;when you use a customization, you will not see your new text, but rather the old text that was active when the customization was saved.</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the purchase order. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the purchase order and sets up the window for you to enter a new PO. Fields in the new PO will be blank or set to default values.</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Issue</span>: Applies to a purchase order that is currently in its draft state. The purchase order is marked as issued. <span class="CButton">Issue</span> has a drop-down list containing the following:</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Issue (With Comment)</span>: Same as <span class="CButton">Issue</span>, but also opens a window where you may record a comment about what you're doing.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Close Purchase Order</span>: Applies to a purchase order that has been issued. The purchase order is marked as closed. MainBoss opens a window where you can record a comment and other information.</p>

<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Re-Draft</span>: Applies to a purchase order that has been voided. The purchase order is put back into the draft state.</p>

This window also lets you set an effective date for the action. For more on recording such information, see <a href="Edit.Purchase%20Order%20State%20History.htm">Purchase Order State History Records</a>.</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Add Purchase Order Comment</span>: Opens a window that allows you to create a state history record for this purchase order. This record has a <span class="CButton">Comments</span> field where you can enter any comments about this PO.
