<p>You create or modify company information using the company information editor. The usual way to open the editor is to click <span class="CButton">Edit</span> in <span class="CPanel">Administration</span> | <span class="CPanel">Company Information</span>.</p>

<p>The company information editor window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Company Logo</span>: If you've already specified a company logo, it will be displayed here. To set or change the logo, click either the "..." button or the associated down-arrow. Both of these will give you the option of choosing a file containing your logo.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Purchasing Contact</span>: Specifies someone in your organization whose name should go on purchase orders as a contact person. For more on purchase orders, see <a href="PurchaseOrders.htm">Purchase Orders</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Organization Name</span>: The name of your organization. By default, this will be the organization name specified at the time this MainBoss database was created.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">MainBoss News URL</span>: The URL of a web page to display in the MainBoss News display. If left blank, the MainBoss News display will reference www.mainboss.com for information about the current operating version of MainBoss</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Company Location</span>: The name and address of your company. This is specified with a postal address location record. (For more on location records, see <a href="Locations.htm">Locations</a>.)

<br /><br />Once you have specified an appropriate location record, your company's name and postal address will appear on all printed requests, work orders and purchase order.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Main Font</span>: The default font for most information printed in reports. You can set or change the font by clicking the associated "..." button; this opens a standard Windows font selection window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Fixed-Pitch Font</span>: The default font for report information that is printed in fixed width (e.g. specifications). You can set or change the font by clicking the associated "..." button; this opens a standard Windows font selection window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Bar Code Symbology</span>: Specifies a default format to be used for printing bar codes. If you choose <span class="CButton">None</span>, the default will be to print no bar codes; otherwise, the chosen bar code format will be set as the default in any report where bar codes may appear. For more information on bar codes, see <a href="BarCodeSupport.htm">Bar Code Support</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Active filter shows only records less than this many days old</span>: If you fill in this field, you change the definition of <span class="CU">Active</span> requests, work orders and purchase orders for everyone using this MainBoss database. For example, if you set the field's value to 400, requests, work orders and purchase orders are only considered active if their most recent history record is less than 400 days old. Remember that this affects everyone who uses the database; if you only want to affect yourself, use <span class="CMenu">Change Active Filter</span> in the <span class="CMenu">View</span> menu. (See <a href="Edit.Active%20Filter.htm">The Active Filter</a>.)</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Active filter shows only records updated since this date</span>: If you fill in this field, you change the definition of <span class="CU">Active</span> requests, work orders and purchase orders for everyone using the MainBoss database. For example, if you set the field to <span class="CU">January 1, 2009</span>, requests, work orders and purchase orders are only considered active if their most recent history record is newer than the given date. Remember that this affects everyone who uses the database; if you only want to affect yourself, use <span class="CMenu">Change Active Filter</span> in the <span class="CMenu">View</span> menu.</p>
<p class="box">Be very careful using "<span class="CField">Active filter shows only records updated since this date</span>". If you don't change the date very often, the lists of active records will keep growing, making it harder and harder to find what you want.</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
