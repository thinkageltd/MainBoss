<p>A chart is special type of report that shows information in a graphical way. A chart report consists of one or more bar charts running either vertically or horizontally.</p>

<p>Some charts use different colors to distinguish different types of data on the same chart. For example, preventive maintenance work orders may be shown in a different color than corrective work orders.</p>

<p>Often the <span class="CButton">Grouping</span> section of a chart report window will determine how chart information is organized. For example, the <span class="CPanel">Costs by Grouping</span> chart shows work order costs organized by whatever option(s) you specify in the <span class="CButton">Grouping</span> section. If you choose <span class="CButton">Work Category</span>, costs are broken down by work category; if you choose <span class="CButton">Unit Location</span>, costs are broken down by location; and so on.</p>

<p>Some data and option selections may lead to charts that are difficult to read. In such cases, we recommend using the <span class="CButton">Filters</span> section to reduce the amount of data you're trying to show in a single chart. Breaking your data into multiple charts may make the final results easier to understand.</p>
