<p>In the <span class="CButton">Task Inside</span> subsection of the <span class="CButton">Task Resources</span> section of a task record, <span class="CButton">New Task Demand Per Job Inside</span> lets you assign inside personnel to the associated task, paid on a per job basis. Whenever a work order is generated from the task, the work order will contain a <span class="CButton">Demand Per Job Inside</span> record for the specified worker. (For more on demand per job inside records, see <a href="Edit.Demand Per Job Inside.htm">Demand Per Job Inside</a>.)</p>

<p>When you click <span class="CButton">New Task Demand Per Job Inside</span> in a task record, MainBoss opens a window that contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Task</span>: The task that contains this demand.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Per Job Inside</span>: A per job inside record specifying the person you want to assign to the job and the price paid for the worker's services. For more on per job inside records, see <a href="PerJobInside.htm">Per Job Inside</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Leave total demanded cost blank when work order is created</span>: If you choose this option, generated work orders will not include cost estimates for this entry. You can supply an estimate after a work order is generated, or simply enter the actual cost once the job is finished.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Estimate total demanded cost when work order is created</span>: If you choose this option, generated work orders will have cost estimates for this entry.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Demanded</span>: The quantity of work expected. This is usually 1 (i.e. you expect the job to be done as described in the per job inside record.)</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Actual Cost Default</span>: Specifies the default method for calculating costs when someone creates an "actual per job inside" in response to this demand. If the person who records the actual cost has sufficient security permissions, he or she can specify the cost in a different way. However, if the person who records the actual cost does not have permission to specify costs, what you specify on this demand determines the cost that MainBoss will use. Possible options are:</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Manual entry</span>: If you choose this option, you expect the person who actualizes this demand to have appropriate security permissions to specify the actual cost of the work.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Current value calculation</span>: If you choose this option, the default is to calculate actual costs from the original per job inside record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Demanded</span>: If you choose this option, the default is to use the estimated cost in the demand as a basis for the actual cost.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Expense Category</span>: The expense category to which this expense belongs. For more on expense categories, see <a href="ExpenseCategories.htm">Expense Categories</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
