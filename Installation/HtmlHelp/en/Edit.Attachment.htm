<p>An <span class="NewTerm">attachment</span> is any computer file that you wish to associate with a unit. For example, if you have files containing schematic diagrams or specifications for a piece of equipment, you might specify those as attachments. As another example, if a unit represents a space rented by a tenant, you might attach a file containing your contract with that tenant so that you know exactly what is and isn't covered by the contract.</p>

<p class="box">To see the contents of an attached file, click the link labeled "<span class="CField">Path</span>" in the <span class="CButton">Attachments</span> section of the associated unit record, or click <span class="CButton">Open Attachment</span> in the editor window.</p>

<p>To add an attachment to a unit record, click <span class="CButton">New Attachment</span> in the <span class="CButton">Attachments</span> section of the record. This opens a window containing the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Unit</span>: A read-only field identifying the unit.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Code</span>: A name identifying the file. For example, you might use <span class="CU">Schematic Diagrams</span> to identify such a file. "<span class="CField">Name</span>" does <span class="Emphasis">not</span> have to be the actual name of the file; for example, if the file's real name doesn't suggest what the file contains, you can use "<span class="CField">Name</span>" to describe the file's purpose and/or contents.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Description</span>: A fuller description of what the file contains.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Path</span>: The name of the file you want to attach. This can be the full name of a file on your computer or network. If you have an Internet connection, it can also be a URL.

<br /><br />For file names, you can either type the name of the file or use the "..." button to locate the file.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Comments:</span> Any comments you wish to record about the file, or about the associated unit.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Open Attachment</span>: Opens the specified "<span class="CField">Path</span>" using whatever program is used for that purpose on your system. For example, if "<span class="CField">Path</span>" is a URL, it will be opened with your web browser.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
