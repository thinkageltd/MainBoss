<p>You can record a meter reading from a work order. Start in the work order's <span class="CButton">Meters</span> section, click on a meter, and click <span class="CButton">New Work Order Meter Reading</span>. The resulting window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Meter Class</span>: A read-only field giving the class of the meter whose reading you are recording. For more, see <a href="MeterClasses.htm">Meter Classes</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Unit</span>: A read-only field giving the unit with which the meter is associated. For more on units, see <a href="Units.htm">Units</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Meter Class UOM</span>: A read-only field giving the units of measure associated with this meter. For more on units of measure, see <a href="UnitsofMeasure.htm">Units of Measure</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Reading Offset</span>: A read-only field giving the offset associated with this meter. For more, see the section titled <span class="CInset">Effective vs. Actual Readings</span> in <a href="Meters.htm">Meters</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Current</span>: A line of read-only fields giving the most recent reading on the meter. If no reading has ever been recorded for the meter, "<span class="CField">Entry Date</span>" and "<span class="CField">Effective Date</span>" will both show the current date, "<span class="CField">Reading</span>" will be zero, and "<span class="CField">Effective Reading</span>" will be equal to "<span class="CField">Reading Offset</span>".</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Entry Date</span>: A read-only field giving today's date.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Effective Date</span>: The date/time when the reading was taken. As an initial default, this shows today's date and time; however, you should change this to reflect the actual date and time on which the reading was made.

<br /><br /><span class="CInset">Important:</span> MainBoss will not let you enter a meter reading with an "<span class="CField">Effective Date</span>" that is older than the most recent reading on the meter. You must enter meter readings in chronological order. This is especially important during set-up: if you want to enter old meter readings (to create a meter history), you must enter the readings in the order they occurred. If you want to enter older meter readings, you have to delete any more recent readings first.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Reading</span>: The actual reading from the meter. When you type a number in this field, MainBoss automatically sets "<span class="CField">Effective Reading</span>" to "<span class="CField">Reading</span>" plus "<span class="CField">Reading Offset</span>".</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Effective Reading</span>: The sum of "<span class="CField">Reading</span>" and "<span class="CField">Reading Offset</span>". This gives you the true value of the meter, after adjusting for roll-over, resetting, and other special conditions.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
