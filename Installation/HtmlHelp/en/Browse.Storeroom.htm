<p>You view storeroom records with <span class="CPanel">Coding Definitions</span> | <span class="CPanel">Items</span> | <span class="CPanel">Storerooms</span>. The window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">View</span> section: Shows a location map that lists current storerooms.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Code</span>: Click this heading to sort the map by code. Click again to reverse the order (from ascending to descending or vice versa).</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Description</span>: Click this heading to sort the list by description. Click again to reverse the order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Apply Filter</span>: Lets you set up a <span class="NewTerm">filter</span> to select which records should be shown in the table. For more information, see <a href="Filter.htm">Table Filters</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Details</span> section: Shows information from the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Storeroom Assignments</span> section: Shows storeroom assignments associated with the selected storeroom. For more, see <a href="StoreroomAssignments.htm">Storeroom Assignments</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Temporary Storage and Items</span> section: Shows temporary storage and temporary assignments associated with the selected storeroom. For more, see <a href="Edit.Temporary Storage.htm">Temporary Storage Locations</a> and <a href="Edit.Temporary Storage Assignment.htm">Temporary Storage Assignments</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">New Storeroom</span>: Opens a window to create a new storeroom record. Fields in the new record will either be blank or assigned default values (as specified in the <span class="CButton">Defaults for Storerooms</span> section).</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Edit.png" alt="Edit" /></span>: This drop-down button offers several possible actions:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Edit</span>: Opens an editor window to let you edit the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">View</span>: Opens an editor window where you can examine the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Restore</span>: Restores a deleted record. This button is only active if the viewer is in <span class="CU">All</span> mode and if you've selected a deleted record. When you click <span class="CButton">Restore</span>, MainBoss will open a window that lets you examine the contents of the deleted record. If you save the record and close the window, the record will be restored to the <span class="CU">Active</span> list.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Show on Map</span>: If the currently selected storeroom has a "<span class="CField">GIS Location</span>" field, MainBoss attempts to open Google Maps to a map showing the storeroom's geographic location. If the current storeroom doesn't have a GIS location, MainBoss checks the unit and/or location record that contains the storeroom, then the container of the container, and so on, until MainBoss either finds a record that has a GIS location or else reaches a record with no container.

<br /><br />If MainBoss finds no record with a GIS location, but does find a postal address record containing postal information, MainBoss passes the postal information to Google Maps.

<br /><br />In order to see the geographic location in Google Maps, you must have an active Internet connection and a suitable web browser.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Delete.png" alt="Delete" /></span>: Deletes the record that's currently selected.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="PrintHS.png" alt="Print" /></span>: Opens a window to let you print your storeroom records. For more information, see <a href="Report.Storeroom.htm">Printing Storeroom Records</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Export.png" alt="Export" /></span>: Lets you export data from this table or import data from a file (provided that the file is in an acceptable format). For more information, see <a href="ImportingandExportingDatainTables.htm">Importing and Exporting Data in Tables</a>.

<br /><br />The button has an accompanying drop-down list containing the following:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Export</span>: Exports data in XML format.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Import</span>: Imports data from a properly formatted file.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Save XML Schema</span>: Writes an XML schema for this table into a specified file.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span>: Lets you search through the list of records for a particular record. For more information, see <a href="Search.htm">Searching for a Particular Record</a>. The <span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span> button has an accompanying drop-down list containing the following:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Find Next</span>: Uses the same search condition(s) as your most recent search and finds the next record in the table that matches the condition(s). If the search reaches the end of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the start of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Find Previous</span>: Same as <span class="CButton">Find Next</span> except that it goes backward in the table. If the search reaches the start of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the end of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Defaults for Storerooms</span> section: Shows any defaults to be used when creating new storerooms.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Edit Defaults</span>: Opens a window to let you change the displayed default values.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
