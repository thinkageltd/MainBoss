<p>MainBoss allows standard Windows keyboard shortcuts such as <span class="CKey">&lt;Ctrl+C&gt;</span> for copy and <span class="CKey">&lt;Ctrl+V&gt;</span> for paste.</p>

<p>You can also use <span class="CKey">&lt;Tab&gt;</span> to move to the next field in a window. If you're filling out a form, you can just tab from one field to another rather than using the mouse. <span class="CKey">&lt;Shift+Tab&gt;</span> moves backward to the previous field.</p>

<p>In any table viewer, the shortcut sequence <span class="CKey">&lt;Ctrl+F&gt;</span> opens the search window. The search will be applied to whatever list of records you clicked most recently. For example, if you most recently clicked a list of unit records, <span class="CKey">&lt;Ctrl+F&gt;</span> will let you search through units. However, if you were looking at a unit record and your most recent click was on the unit's list of service contracts, then <span class="CKey">&lt;Ctrl+F&gt;</span> would search through service contracts. (<span class="CKey">&lt;Ctrl+F&gt;</span> will not work if your most recent click was on the MainBoss control panel&#8212;it only works if your most recent click was in some sort of table viewer.)</p>

<p>If the search window is not open, the <span class="CKey">&lt;F3&gt;</span> function key has the effect of <span class="CButton">Find Next</span>, searching for whatever you searched for most recently. This means that pressing <span class="CKey">&lt;F3&gt;</span> repeatedly will perform the same search over and over.</p>

<p>MainBoss buttons often allow keyboard shortcuts. To see the shortcuts in a window, press the <span class="CKey">&lt;Alt&gt;</span> key. One letter of each button will be underlined, as in <span class="CButton">S</span><span class="BL">ave</span>. Pressing <span class="CKey">&lt;Alt&gt;</span> plus the underlined letter is equivalent to clicking the button, so that <span class="CKey">&lt;Alt+S&gt;</span> is equivalent to clicking the <span class="CButton">S</span><span class="BL">ave</span> button.</p>
