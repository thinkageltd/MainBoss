<p>You view user authorizations with <span class="CPanel">Administration | MainBoss Users</span>. The window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Details</span> section: Shows the list of current users.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Authentication Credential</span>: Click this heading to sort the login name or SQL Server name under which the user accesses the MainBoss database. Click again to reverse the order (from ascending to descending or vice versa).</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Contact</span>: Click this heading to sort by the contact name associated with each user. Click again to reverse the order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Description</span>: Click this heading to sort the list by description. Click again to reverse the order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Apply Filter</span>: Lets you set up a <span class="NewTerm">filter</span> to select which records should be shown in the table. For more information, see <a href="Filter.htm">Table Filters</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">New User</span>: Opens a window to create a new user record. Fields in the new record will either be blank or assigned default values (as specified in the <span class="CButton">Defaults for Users</span> section).

<br /><br />Only someone with SQL Server Administration privileges can register new users with SQL Server. You will receive an error message if you try to add a new user but do not have appropriate permissions.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Details</span>: Lists basic information taken from the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Security Role</span>: Lists the security roles associated with the selected user.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Advanced</span>: Lists any advanced information associated with the selected user record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Edit.png" alt="Edit" /></span>: This drop-down button offers several possible actions:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Edit</span>: Opens an editor window to let you edit the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">View</span>: Opens an editor window where you can examine the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Restore</span>: Restores a deleted record. This button is only active if the viewer is in <span class="CU">All</span> mode and if you've selected a deleted record. When you click <span class="CButton">Restore</span>, MainBoss will open a window that lets you examine the contents of the deleted record. If you save the record and close the window, the record will be restored to the <span class="CU">Active</span> list.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Evaluate Security As</span>: Lets you see the effect of the selected user's security roles. See below for more details.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Delete.png" alt="Delete" /></span>: Deletes the record that's currently selected.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="PrintHS.png" alt="Print" /></span>: Prints information about users. For more information, see <a href="Report.MainBoss%20User.htm">Printing User Records</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Export.png" alt="Export" /></span>: Lets you export data from this table or import data from a file (provided that the file is in an acceptable format). For more information, see <a href="ImportingandExportingDatainTables.htm">Importing and Exporting Data in Tables</a>.

<br /><br />The button has an accompanying drop-down list containing the following:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Export</span>: Exports data in XML format.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Import</span>: Imports data from a properly formatted file.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Save XML Schema</span>: Writes an XML schema for this table into a specified file.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span>: Lets you search through the list of records for a particular record. For more information, see <a href="Search.htm">Searching for a Particular Record</a>. The <span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span> button has an accompanying drop-down list containing the following:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Find Next</span>: Uses the same search condition(s) as your most recent search and finds the next record in the table that matches the condition(s). If the search reaches the end of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the start of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Find Previous</span>: Same as <span class="CButton">Find Next</span> except that it goes backward in the table. If the search reaches the start of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the end of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Defaults for Users</span> section: Shows any defaults to be used when creating new user records.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Edit Defaults</span>: Opens a window to let you change the displayed default values.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
<p><span class="CInset">Evaluating Security Roles:</span> When you assign security roles to a user, it can be difficult to figure out the effect of those roles: what the user can and can't do with the roles you've assigned.</p>

<p>To make it easier to see the effects of a person's security roles, you can use the <span class="CButton">Evaluate Security As</span> button. If you select a user in the Users table, then click this button, your MainBoss session changes to have the same security permissions as the selected user. If certain types of data are invisible to that user, they'll become invisible to you too; if certain buttons are disabled, they'll be disabled for you too.</p>

<p class="box"><span class="CButton">Evaluate Security As</span> is a very powerful feature. It is only available to people with the <span class="CU">Administration</span> security role.</p>

<p><span class="CButton">Evaluate Security As</span> gives you the same security roles as the selected user, but it does <span class="Emphasis">not</span> change who you are. In particular, you keep your own set of assigned requests, work orders and purchase orders.</p>

<p class="box"><span class="CInset">Note:</span> If you use this feature to evaluate the security roles of someone who doesn't have <span class="CU">Administration</span> or <span class="CU">AdministrationView</span>, the first thing that will happen is that you lose permission to see <span class="CPanel">Administration | MainBoss Users</span>. This may look as if you're being told that you don't have permission to use <span class="CButton">Evaluate Security As</span>; however, it really means that the person you're evaluating doesn't have that permission. You may also receive unusual error messages because of conflicts between your own security roles and the roles of the person you're evaluating.</p>

<p>Once you've examined what the user can and can't do, you can return to your own security roles by going to the <span class="CMenu">Session</span> menu and clicking <span class="CMenu">Reset to user YOURNAME security</span>.</p>
