<p><a href="Browse.Request.htm">&lt; Previous section</a>&nbsp; | &nbsp;<a href="TableOfContents.htm">Table of Contents</a>&nbsp; | &nbsp;<a href="Index.htm">Index</a>&nbsp; | &nbsp;<a href="Browse.In%20Progress%20Request.htm">Next section &gt;</a></p>

<p>You view new requests with <span class="CPanel">Requests</span> | <span class="CPanel">New Request</span>. A request is new if it has not been marked as in progress, has not been used as the basis of a work order, and has not been closed. The viewer contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">View</span> section: Shows the current list of new requests. New requests are ones that have not yet been marked as in progress.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Number</span>: Click this heading to sort the list by request number. Click again to reverse the order (from ascending to descending or vice versa).</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Requestor</span>: Click this heading to sort the list by requestor. Click again to reverse the order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Subject</span>: Click this heading to sort the list by subject. Click again to reverse the order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Apply Filter</span>: Lets you set up a <span class="NewTerm">filter</span> to select which records should be shown in the table. For more information, see <a href="Filter.htm">Table Filters</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Details</span> section: Shows information from the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Assignments</span> section: Shows people assigned to this request.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Email Request</span> section: If this request originated from an email message, this will list the contents of the message. (Email requests are only possible if you have licensed the MainBoss Service module.)</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Work Orders</span> section: Lists work orders associated with the selected request.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">State History</span> section: Contains an entry for each time the selected request changed its state. For example, this section might list when a request was created, when it was marked "in progress", and when it was closed.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">New Request</span>: Opens a window to create a new request. Fields in the new record will either be blank or assigned default values (as specified in the <span class="CButton">Defaults for Requests</span> section).</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Edit.png" alt="Edit" /></span>: This drop-down button offers several possible actions:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Edit</span>: Opens an editor window to let you edit the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">View</span>: Opens an editor window where you can examine the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="PrintHS.png" alt="Print" /></span>: Opens a window where you can print some or all of your requests. For more, see <a href="Report.Request.htm">Printing Requests</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">In Progress</span>: Marks the request as in progress. <span class="CButton">In Progress</span> also has the following drop-down choices:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">In Progress (With Comment)</span>: Marks the request as "in progress". MainBoss will also open a window where you can record a comment about what you're doing.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Void</span>: Cancels the selected request. MainBoss will also open a window where you can record a comment explaining why you are canceling the request.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Close Request</span>, <span class="CButton">Close Request (With Comment)</span>, <span class="CButton">Reopen</span>: Are disabled in this table viewer because they can't be applied to new requests.</p>
<p class="box">As noted above, some of the "state-change" operations open a window where you can record comments about what you're doing. This window also gives you an opportunity to record comments to be sent to the original requestor. If you have the MainBoss Service module, these comments are automatically emailed to the requestor. The comments are also recorded in the request's <span class="CButton">State History</span> section. For further information, see <a href="Edit.Request%20State%20History.htm">Editing Request State History Records</a>.</p>

<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span>: Lets you search through the list of records for a particular record. For more information, see <a href="Search.htm">Searching for a Particular Record</a>. The <span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span> button has an accompanying drop-down list containing the following:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Find Next</span>: Uses the same search condition(s) as your most recent search and finds the next record in the table that matches the condition(s). If the search reaches the end of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the start of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Find Previous</span>: Same as <span class="CButton">Find Next</span> except that it goes backward in the table. If the search reaches the start of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the end of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Link Work Orders</span>: Lets you indicate that this request is associated with an existing work order. This is useful if you get several requests reporting the same problem. The first time someone submits a particular complaint, you can use <span class="CButton">New Work Order</span> to make a work order to fix the problem. If other people complain about the same thing, you can use <span class="CButton">Link Work Orders</span> to associate their requests with the work order you've already created. This makes it easier to keep track of which requests are associated with which work orders.

<br /><br />Note that it's also possible for a single request to be associated with multiple work orders. For example, you might create one work order for a short-term work-around fix, and another work order for a more permanent repair. Using <span class="CButton">Link Work Orders</span> lets you associate the request with both work orders.

<br /><br />A request may be linked to any number of work orders and vice versa. When you click <span class="CButton">Link Work Orders</span>, you get the window described in <a href="Edit.Requested%20Work%20Order.htm">Requested Work Orders</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">New Work Order</span>: Opens a window that lets you create a work order based on the selected request. Information from the request will be copied into the new work order; however, this information can be changed if desired. For more on creating and editing work orders, see <a href="Edit.Work%20Order.htm">Editing Work Orders</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">New Requestor Comment</span>: Lets you record a comment for the requestor. If you have the MainBoss Service module, this comment will be automatically emailed to the requestor. If not, you will have to convey the comment to the requestor in some other way.

<br /><br />You can click <span class="CButton">New Requestor Comment</span> on a request as often as you like; each time, MainBoss will give you a chance to record a comment about the request. <span class="CButton">New Requestor Comment</span> therefore gives you a good way to keep track of problems, delays, and other special situations that arise during the course of a request, and to keep the requestor informed about these situations.

<br /><br />Each requestor comment is recorded in the request's <span class="CButton">State History</span> section. For more on state histories, see <a href="Edit.Request%20State%20History.htm">Editing Request State History Records</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Defaults for Requests</span> section: Shows any defaults to be used when creating new requests.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Details</span> subsection: Shows the default values that will be put into various fields when you first create a new request.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Close Preferences</span> subsection: Shows how requests should be changed in response to any changes in a related work order. For more details, see <a href="Edit.Work%20Order%20Request%20Transition.htm">Specifying Request State Transitions</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Edit Defaults</span>: Opens a window to let you change the displayed default values.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
