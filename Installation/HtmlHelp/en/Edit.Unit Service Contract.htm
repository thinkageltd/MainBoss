<p>When creating a unit record, you can use the <span class="CButton">Service</span> section of the record to specify that the unit is covered by a service contract. By the same token, when creating a service contract record, you can use the <span class="CButton">Units</span> section of the record to list the units that are covered by the contract. In both cases, if you click <span class="CButton">New Unit Service Contract</span> or <span class="CButton">Edit</span>, MainBoss will open a window that contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Unit</span>: Specifies a unit that is covered by the service contract.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Description</span>, <span class="CField">Make</span>, <span class="CField">Model</span>, <span class="CField">Serial</span>: Read-only fields giving information taken from the record for the specified unit.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Service Contract</span>: The service contract that covers the unit.</p>
<p class="wi">Read-only fields: Provide information from the record for the specified service contract.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
