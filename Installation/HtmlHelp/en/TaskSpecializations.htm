<p> A <span class="NewTerm">task specialization</span> is a specialized version of another task. For example, suppose you have a standard <span class="CU">Oil Change</span> task which describes a standard oil change. However, the oil change for a particular vehicle might require a different type of oil, extra inspection operations, or other differences from the standard. In this case, you can create a task specialization based on the original <span class="CU">Oil Change</span> task. The specialization states ways in which the special job differs from the original. The following rules control what happens when a work order is generated from a task specialization:</p>

<ul class="b1"><li>Information in the specialization is <span class="Emphasis">added</span> to the original whenever possible. For example, the task description in a generated work order will consist of the description in the original task <span class="Emphasis">plus</span> any description in the specialization. Similarly, the work order will contain all resources from the original <span class="Emphasis">plus</span> all resources from the specialization.</li>
<li>Information in the specialization <span class="Emphasis">replaces</span> information from the original when the two can't coexist. For example, a work order can only have a single priority. Therefore, if the original task description has one priority and the specialization has a different one, the work order will take its priority setting from the specialization.
</li></ul><p>A task specialization can be used wherever a task can. For example, you can schedule a specialized task in the same way that you schedule a basic task. Similarly, you can create a specialization of a specialization.</p>

<p>In the <span class="CPanel">Tasks</span> viewer and other viewers, tasks and specializations are shown using a map similar to a location map. Specializations are shown under and indented from their base tasks.</p>
