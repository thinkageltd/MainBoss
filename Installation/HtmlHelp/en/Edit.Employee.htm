<p>You create or modify employee records using the employee editor. The usual way to open the editor is to click <span class="CButton">New Employee</span> or <span class="CButton">Edit</span> in the <span class="CButton">View</span> section of <span class="CPanel">Coding Definitions</span> | <span class="CPanel">Work Orders</span> | <span class="CPanel">Labor</span> | <span class="CPanel">Employees</span>.</p>

<p>The employee editor window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Details</span> section: Shows basic information for the record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Contact</span>: A record in the contacts table giving contact information for the employee. You must create the contact record before you can create the employee record. For more on contacts, see <a href="Contacts.htm">Contacts</a>. (Once you specify a contact record, MainBoss displays the person's phone number and email address in read-only fields.)</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Description</span>: Typically the employee's name.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Comments</span>: Any comments you want to associate with the employee.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Hourly Inside</span> section: Shows any hourly inside rates associated with the selected employee. Before you can record any entries in this list, you must <span class="CButton">Save</span> the employee record. For more on hourly inside records, see <a href="HourlyInside.htm">Hourly Inside</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Task Demand Hourly Inside</span> section: Shows any hourly inside demands associated with tasks for the selected employee. Before you can record any entries in this list, you must <span class="CButton">Save</span> the employee record. For more on tasks, see <a href="Tasks.htm">Tasks</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Per Job Inside</span> section: Shows any per job inside rates associated with the selected employee. Before you can record any entries in this list, you must <span class="CButton">Save</span> the employee record. For more on per job inside records, see <a href="PerJobInside.htm">Per Job Inside</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Task Demand Per Job Inside</span> section: Shows any per job inside demands associated with tasks for the selected employee. Before you can record any entries in this list, you must <span class="CButton">Save</span> the employee record. For more on tasks, see <a href="Tasks.htm">Tasks</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
