<p>If you have created a maintenance organization with an earlier version of MainBoss, you can upgrade it to the current version.</p>

<p class="box">The following information applies to upgrading data from an earlier version of MainBoss. For importing data from MainBoss Basic, see the Installation and Administration Guide.</p>

<p><span class="BL">Before you upgrade your database, create a backup copy using the standard back-up procedures of SQL Server. This protects your data in the event of a power failure or some other problem.</p>
</span>
<p>To upgrade your maintenance organization, click <span class="CButton">Upgrade</span> (as described in <a href="Browse.Organization.htm">Your Maintenance Organization List</a>). This opens a window that provides information on your maintenance organization and your current version of MainBoss. The window also contains the following buttons:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Upgrade</span>: Click this to go ahead with the upgrade process.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window (whether or not you've upgraded the database).</p>
