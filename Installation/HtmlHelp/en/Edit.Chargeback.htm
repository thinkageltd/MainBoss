<p>The Chargeback editor lets you create the main record of a chargeback, specifying the party who will be charged for maintenance work. It also lets you specify chargeback activity records, which give itemized details of the charges.</p>

<p>To open the Chargebacks editor, click <span class="CButton">New Chargeback</span> or <span class="CButton">Edit</span> in the <span class="CButton">Chargebacks</span> section of a work order or in <span class="CPanel">Work Orders</span> | <span class="CPanel">Chargebacks</span>. The window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Details</span> section: Shows basic information for the record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Work Order</span>: The work order with which the chargeback will be associated.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Code</span>: An identification code for this chargeback record (e.g. the invoice number that will be used when billing the client).</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Billable Requestor</span>: The person or organization being charged for this work. For more, see <a href="BillableRequestors.htm">Billable Requestors</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Business Phone</span> and <span class="CField">Email</span>: Read-only fields giving the requestor's phone number and email address (as taken from the requestor's entry in the <span class="CPanel">Contacts</span> table).</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Total Cost</span>: A read-only field giving the total cost of the charges associated with this record. MainBoss calculates this cost by adding up the costs of all the entries in the <span class="CButton">Chargeback Activity</span> section.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Comments</span>: Any internal comments you want to record about this job.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Chargeback Activities</span> section: The details of the costs that are actually being charged.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">New Chargeback Activity</span>: Adds a new entry to the chargeback activity list. MainBoss will open a window where you can enter the information. For more, see <a href="Edit.Chargeback%20Activity.htm">Editing Chargeback Activity Records</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Correct</span>: Opens a window where you can correct an existing chargeback. This lets you make corrections to monetary values.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Edit.png" alt="Edit" /></span>: This drop-down button offers several possible actions:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Edit</span>: Opens an editor window to let you edit the selected record. You will only be able to edit the comments associated with the record; to change other information, you must use <span class="CButton">Correct</span>.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">View</span>: Opens an editor window where you can examine the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span>: Opens a window that lets you search for a particular entry in the list.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect recent changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
