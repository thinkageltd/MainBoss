<p>In the <span class="CButton">Line Items</span> section of a purchase order, when you click <span class="CButton">Receive</span> on a Miscellaneous line item, MainBoss displays the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Entry Date</span>: A read-only field giving the actual date and time when this entry was made.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Effective Date</span>: The date/time that you want to say the miscellaneous item was received. The default is the current date and time.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">User Contact</span>: A read-only field giving your name. This will appear in MainBoss's accounting history to show who recorded the receipt.</p>
<p class="wi">Read-only fields: A series of read-only fields giving information from the purchase order.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Receipt</span>: The receipt where this miscellaneous item was received. (This may be a read-only field if you started from a receipt record.)</p>
<p class="wi">Read-only fields: A series of read-only fields giving information from the receipt record. These fields also state how much of the miscellaneous item was originally ordered.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Use order remaining quantity</span>: If you checkmark this box, MainBoss will use "<span class="CField">Order Remaining</span>" as the actual quantity you received. If you leave the box blank, you must fill in "<span class="CField">Quantity</span>" yourself.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Quantity</span>: The actual quantity of the miscellaneous item that you received.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Calculated Remaining Order Cost</span>: Read-only fields giving the cost of the given "<span class="CField">Quantity</span>" based on existing price information.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Use calculated remaining order cost</span>: If you checkmark this box, MainBoss will use "<span class="CField">Calculated Cost</span>" as the actual cost of what you received. If you leave the box blank, you must fill the cost into "<span class="CField">This Entry</span>" yourself.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">This Entry</span>: The actual cost of the miscellaneous item received.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">As Corrected</span>: If there has been a correction for this record, this line will have read-only fields giving the corrected values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">From Cost Center</span>, <span class="CField">To Cost Center</span>: Read-only fields telling the cost centers involved in this operation. MainBoss creates accounting records indicating the transfer of money from the first cost center to the second. These fields are only visible if your database has an <span class="BL">Accounting</span> license key. For more, see <a href="AccountingFacilities.htm">Accounting Facilities</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
