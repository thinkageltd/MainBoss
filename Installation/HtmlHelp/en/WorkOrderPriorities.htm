<p>When you create a work order with MainBoss, it is often useful to specify how urgent the job is. The Work Order Priorities table lists priorities that may be assigned to the work order. Here are some examples:</p>

<pre>Immediately
Within 8 hours
Within 24 hours
When time permits</pre>

<p class="box"><span class="CInset">Note:</span> For more on work orders, see <a href="WorkOrders.htm">Work Orders</a>.)</p>

<p>Every work order priority may have a rank. A rank is a number used to sort priorities by urgency. Give the most urgent priority the lowest number. For example, you might give the most urgent priority a rank of 1, the next most urgent a rank of 2, and so on. However, the rank numbers do <span class="Emphasis">not</span> have to start at 1 and they do not have to be consecutive; you might give the most urgent priority a rank of 10, the next most urgent a rank of 20, and so on. This leaves room so that you can add new priorities between existing priorities, in future.</p>

<p class="box">Work orders with explicit priorities are considered more urgent than ones where the priority field is blank. Therefore, if you sort your work orders by priority, those with no explicit priority will come last.</p>

<p>The priorities available for work orders may be different from the priorities used for work requests. For more on work request priorities, see <a href="RequestPriorities.htm">Request Priorities</a>.</p>
