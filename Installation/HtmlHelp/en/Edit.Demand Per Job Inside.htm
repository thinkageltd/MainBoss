<p>A per job inside demand assigns one of your workers to do some or all of the work associated with a work order. You specify the worker using a per job inside record; this gives the worker's name and the per job rate paid for that worker on this particular type of job. (For more on per job inside records, see <a href="PerJobInside.htm">Per Job Inside</a>.)</p>

<p class="box"><span class="CInset">Note:</span> MainBoss has two ways of handling labor expenses: with an hourly rate (where the cost depends on how long the worker takes to do the job) or with a per job rate (where all jobs of a particular type cost the same, no matter how long they take). This section covers per job payments. For more on hourly payment, see <a href="Edit.Demand Hourly Inside.htm">Demand Hourly Inside</a>.</p>

<p>To see the Demand Per Job Inside editor, click <span class="CButton">New Demand Per Job Inside</span> in the <span class="CButton">Inside</span> subsection of the <span class="CButton">Resources</span> section of a work order. For more on resources, see <a href="Resources.htm">Resources</a>.</p>

<p>The Demand Per Job Inside editor contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Details</span> area: Provides information about the demand.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Work Order</span>: A read-only field identifying the work order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Per Job Inside</span>: A per job inside record specifying a worker and price paid for the worker on this type of job.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Per Job Rate</span>: A read-only field giving the worker's cost for this job, as given by the per job inside record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Demanded</span>: The total amount of work the worker is expected to spend on this job.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Already used</span>: A read-only field giving the quantity of work that has already been used on this work order. This amount is set by recording that a certain amount of work has already been done. For example, suppose that a worker is painting rooms and is paid by the room. If the job requires painting six rooms and the worker finishes three the first day, you can actualize a quantity of three rooms at the end of that day. After you do this, "<span class="CField">Already used</span>" will show how much work has already been used and actualized.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Remaining</span>: A read-only field giving the amount of demanded work that has not yet been actualized. This is equal to "<span class="CField">Demanded</span>" minus "<span class="CField">Already used</span>".</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Calculated Cost</span>: Read-only fields giving the expected cost of the demanded work, based on the worker's per job rate. The "<span class="CField">Unit Cost</span>" column gives the cost per unit job and the "<span class="CField">Cost</span>" column gives the total cost.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Use calculated cost</span>: If you checkmark this box, MainBoss will fill in "<span class="CField">Demanded Cost</span>" with the values given in "<span class="CField">Calculated Cost</span>". If you don't want to use the calculated cost, leave the checkbox blank and enter an appropriate cost in "<span class="CField">Demanded Cost</span>".</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Demanded Cost</span>: Can be filled in if you expect the cost to be different than "<span class="CField">Calculated Cost</span>" (e.g. if you have to pay the worker more because of the job is being done on a holiday). You can enter a per job rate under "<span class="CField">Unit Cost</span>" or the total cost under "<span class="CField">Cost</span>".</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Actual Cost Default</span>: Specifies the default method for calculating costs when someone creates an "actual per job inside" in response to this demand. If the person who records the actual cost has sufficient security permissions, he or she can specify the cost in a different way. However, if the person who records the actual cost does not have permission to specify costs, what you specify on this demand determines the cost that MainBoss will use. Possible options are:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Manual entry</span>: If you choose this option, you expect the person who actualizes this demand to have appropriate security permissions to specify the actual cost of the work.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Current value calculation</span>: If you choose this option, the default is to calculate actual costs from the original per job inside record.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Demanded</span>: If you choose this option, the default is to use the "<span class="CField">Demanded Cost</span>" in this window as a basis for the actual cost.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Expense Category</span>: The expense category to which this expense belongs. For more on expense categories, see <a href="ExpenseCategories.htm">Expense Categories</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Actuals</span> section: Records what the work order actually used (as opposed to the preliminary estimates given in the <span class="CButton">Details</span> section). The <span class="CButton">Actuals</span> section also lets you correct any mistakes made in previous "actual" entries.</p>
<p class="wi2">List: The central part of the window is a list of "actual" entries, specifying actual per job inside labor expenses on this work order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">New Actual Per Job Inside</span>: Lets you record an actual labor expense for this work order. For more information, see <a href="Edit.Actual Per Job Inside.htm">Actual Per Job Inside</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Correct</span>: Lets you correct an existing actual entry. For more, see <a href="Edit.Correction of Actual Per Job Inside.htm">Corrections of Actual Per Job Inside</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Edit.png" alt="Edit" /></span>: Lets you edit an existing actual entry. You will <span class="Emphasis">not</span> be able to change the cost or quantity specified in the entry; for that, you must use <span class="CButton">Correct</span>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">View</span>: Lets you view an existing entry in read-only mode.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span>: Opens a window to search for a particular record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
