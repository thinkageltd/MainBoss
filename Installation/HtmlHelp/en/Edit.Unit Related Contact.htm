<p>You create unit-to-contact relationships by clicking <span class="CButton">New Unit Related Contact</span> in the <span class="CButton">Contact Relations</span> section of a unit or contact record. The editor window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Relationship</span>: The relationship between the unit and the contact person. This must be a relationship record; for more on relationships, see <a href="Relationships.htm">Relationships</a>.</p>
<p class="box">Once you specify a relationship, the blank field between "<span class="CField">Contact</span>" and "<span class="CField">Unit</span>" will be filled in with the appropriate phrase from the relationship record. For example, if the relationship states that the contact leases the unit, the blank field will be filled in with <span class="CU">Leases</span>.</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Unit</span>: The unit that takes part in this relationship. For more on units, see <a href="Units.htm">Units</a>.

<br /><br />If you got to this window by clicking the <span class="CButton">New Unit Related Contact</span> button in a unit record, the "<span class="CField">Unit</span>" field will already be filled in with the name of the unit. This cannot be changed.

<br /><br />Otherwise, if you got to this window by clicking <span class="CButton">New Unit Related Contact</span> in a contact record, the "<span class="CField">Unit</span>" field will be blank. You can use the multi-select dropdown box to select one or more units that have the chosen relationship with the original contact.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Contact</span>: The contact person who takes part in this relationship. For more on contacts, see <a href="Contacts.htm">Contacts</a>.

<br /><br />If you got to this window by clicking the <span class="CButton">New Unit Related Contact</span> button in a contact record, the "<span class="CField">Contact</span>" field will already be filled in with the name of the contact. This cannot be changed.

<br /><br />Otherwise, if you got to this window by clicking <span class="CButton">New Unit Related Contact</span> in a unit record, the "<span class="CField">Contact</span>" field will be blank. You can use the multi-select dropdown box to select one or more contacts who have the chosen relationship with the original unit.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
