<p>Clicking <span class="CButton">New Purchase Template Item</span> in the <span class="CButton">Purchase Order Template Lines</span> section of a purchase order template opens a window that lets you add an item to the template. When a purchase order is generated from the template, the item will be included in the purchase order.</p>

<p>The editor window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Line Number Rank</span>: A number indicating where this item should be placed on generated purchase orders. This is useful when a task has multiple purchase templates associated with it, and line items from the different templates must be merged to make a single purchase order.

<br /><br />Line items on the generated purchase order will be sorted from lowest rank number to highest (so an item numbered 1 will come before one numbered 2). Ranks do not have to be completely sequential (so that you might have ranks, 1, 4, 5, 10, with gaps between the numbers). If multiple items have the same rank, MainBoss will randomly choose which one goes first.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Purchase Order Template</span>: A read-only field identifying the purchase order template where this item will appear.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Storage Assignment</span>: This area lets you specify a storage assignment that states what item you want to purchase and where you want to store it. At the bottom of this area is a drop-down list which will display storage assignments based on the options specified in the "<span class="CField">Storage Assignment</span>" area. By choosing appropriate options, you can reduce the entries that are shown in the drop-down list, making it quicker and easier to choose the one you want. The possible options are:</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Only include Storage Assignments which have a preferred Price Quote associated with them</span>: A storage assignment record may or may not specify a <span class="NewTerm">preferred price</span> for an item. If you select this option, the "<span class="CField">Storage Assignment</span>" drop-down list will only show storage assignments that have such a price.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Only include Storage Assignments for items which have a Price Quote associated with them</span>: If you select this option, the "<span class="CField">Storage Assignment</span>" drop-down list will only show storage assignments for items whose records give a price quote.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Only include Storage Assignments for items which have previously been received</span>: If you select this option, the "<span class="CField">Storage Assignment</span>" drop-down list will only show storage assignments for items which have been previously purchased (i.e. that show up in MainBoss's purchasing history). Typically, this option is combined with <span class="CButton">Use Pricing or Purchasing history only for the Purchase Order Template's vendor</span>, in which case the drop-down list only shows items you've purchased from the same vendor.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Do not filter Storage Assignments based on Pricing or Purchasing History</span>: If you select this option, the "<span class="CField">Storage Assignment</span>" drop-down list will not be affected by any of the preceding options.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Use Pricing or Purchasing history only for the Purchase Order Template's Vendor</span>: If you checkmark this box, the "<span class="CField">Storage Assignment</span>" drop-down list only shows storage assignment records with price quotes or purchases from the same vendor as the purchase order.</p>
<p class="wi2">Drop-down list: The drop-down list at the end of the "<span class="CField">Storage Assignment</span>" area shows storage assignments that satisfy the options you have specified. For more on storeroom assignments, see <a href="StoreroomAssignments.htm">Storeroom Assignments</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Quantity</span>: Read-only fields telling current quantities of the item in the storeroom specified by "<span class="CField">Storage Assignment</span>".</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Storage Assignment Item Price Order Line Text</span>: Read-only field giving the text for this item as given in "<span class="CField">Storage Assignment</span>" (if any).</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Use minimum quantity</span>: If you checkmark this box, MainBoss will fill in "<span class="CField">Quantity</span>" with the "<span class="CField">Minimum</span>" value given in the read-only "<span class="CField">Quantity</span>" line. If you leave the box blank, you must fill in "<span class="CField">Quantity</span>" yourself.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Quantity</span>: The quantity of the item that you want to order.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Storage Assignment Item UOM</span>: A read-only field giving the unit of measurement for this item (taken from the item record).</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
