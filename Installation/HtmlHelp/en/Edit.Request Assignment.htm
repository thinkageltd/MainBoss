<p>You can assign someone to a request, provided that the person has an entry in the Requests Assignees table (<span class="CPanel">Coding Definitions</span> | <span class="CPanel">Requests</span> | <span class="CPanel">Request Assignees</span>). When someone is assigned to a request, it indicates that the person has some interest in the request. For further information on assignments, see <a href="Assignments.htm">Assignments</a>.</p>

<p>To assign someone to a request, click the <span class="CButton">New Request Assignment</span> button in <span class="CPanel">Requests</span> | <span class="CPanel">Request Assignments</span> or in the <span class="CButton">Request Assignments</span> section of a request. This opens a window that contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Request</span> area: If you started from a request record, this area will contain a read-only field identifying the request.

<br /><br />If you started from a request assignee record, the <span class="CField">Request</span> area allows you to choose one or more requests to which the person should be assigned. You specify these requests using the multi-select drop-down list at the bottom of the <span class="CField">Request</span> area. Option buttons in the <span class="CField">Request</span> area let you shorten the contents of the drop-down list, to make it easier to choose the requests you want. The option buttons include:</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Only show New Requests</span>: If you choose this option, the drop-down list will only show requests in the New state.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Only show In Progress Requests</span>: If you choose this option, the drop-down list will only show requests in the In Progress state.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Only show Transferred Requests</span>: If you choose this option, the drop-down list will only show requests that have been used to create work orders.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Only show Closed Requests</span>: If you choose this option, the drop-down list will only show requests in the Closed state.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Only show Unassigned Requests</span>: If you choose this option, the drop-down list will only show requests that are <span class="CButton">New</span> or <span class="CButton">In Progress</span> but have no assignments.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Show all Requests</span>: If you choose this option, the drop-down list shows all requests.</p>
<p class="wi2">Drop-down list: A list of all requests that match the criteria specified above.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Assignee</span> area: If you started from a request assignee record, this area will contain a read-only field identifying the request assignee.

<br /><br />If you started from a request record, the <span class="CField">Assignee</span> area lets you specify one or more people to whom you are assigning to this request. The bottom of the area contains a multi-select drop-down list where you can specify the assignees. The options in the area let you reduce the number of possibilities shown in the drop-down list.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Show prospects for Request Assignee for this Request</span>: If you click this option, the drop-down list will show people who are in the Request Assignee table and who are currently associated with this request in some way. This may include people like the Requestor and person who created the request.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Show all Assignees not currently assigned to this Request</span>: If you click this option, the drop-down list will show everyone in the Request Assignee table who isn't already assigned to this request.</p>
<p class="wi2">Drop-down list: A list of all potential assignees who match the criteria specified above.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
