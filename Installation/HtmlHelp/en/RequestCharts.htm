<p>The <span class="CPanel">Requests</span> | <span class="CPanel">Charts</span> section of the control panel lets you obtain charts about your requests. For more about charts, see <a href="Charts.htm">Charts</a>. The following charts are available:</p>

<ul class="b1"><li><a href="Report.Request%20Count%20by%20Creation%20Date.htm">Request Count by Creation Date Chart</a>: divides a range of dates into periods and shows how many requests were created in each period; for example, you might divide the past month into weeks, so that the chart will show you how many requests were created in each week
</li></ul><a href="Report.Request%20Count%20by%20In%20Progress%20Date.htm">Request Count by In Progress Date Chart</a>: divides a range of dates into periods and shows how many requests started in each period; for example, you might divide the past month into weeks, so that the chart will show you how many requests started in each week
<ul class="b1"><li><a href="Report.Request%20Count%20by%20Ended%20Date.htm">Request Count by Ended Date Chart</a>: divides a range of dates into periods and shows how many requests ended in each period; for example, you might divide the past month into weeks, so that the chart will show you how many requests ended in each week
</li></ul><a href="Report.Request%20Count%20by%20Grouping.htm">Request Count by Grouping Chart</a>: once you select a grouping (e.g. work categories), the chart shows the number of requests in each of the relevant groups
<ul class="b1"><li><a href="Report.Average%20Request%20Duration%20Per%20Grouping.htm">Average Request Duration Per Grouping Chart</a>: once you select a grouping (e.g. work categories), the chart shows the average duration of requests in each of the relevant groups
</li></ul><a href="Report.Request%20Lifetime.htm">Request Lifetime Chart</a>: charts giving the total lifetime of a request, from creation date to closing
<ul class="b1"><li><a href="Report.Time%20in%20Request%20Status.htm">Time in Request Status Chart</a>: charts giving the number of hours that requests spent in a particular state and/or with a particular status code
</li></ul><p class="box">Some data and option selections may lead to charts that are difficult to read. In such cases, we recommend using the <span class="CButton">Filters</span> section to reduce the amount of data you're trying to show in a single chart. Breaking your data into multiple charts may make the final results easier to understand.</p>
