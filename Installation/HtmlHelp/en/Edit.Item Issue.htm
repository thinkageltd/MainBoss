<p>Inventory items are usually used in the course of a work order. However, you might occasionally use items for other purposes, as described in <a href="ItemIssueCodes.htm">Item Issue Codes</a>. To record such a usage, you must create an <span class="NewTerm">issue</span> record.</p>

<p>You can create an issue record by going to <span class="CPanel">Items</span> | <span class="CPanel">Storeroom Assignments</span> or <span class="CPanel">Coding Definitions</span> | <span class="CPanel">Items</span> | <span class="CPanel">Storeroom Assignments</span> or by using <span class="CButton">New Item Issue</span> in the <span class="CButton">Resources</span> section of a work order. Select the storeroom assignment corresponding to the item and the storeroom where the issue took place. Click <span class="CButton">Edit</span> to open the storeroom assignment record and then click <span class="CButton">New Item Issue</span>; MainBoss will open a window where you can record information about the issue action. The window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Entry Date</span>: A read-only field giving the date that this record was created.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Effective Date</span>: The date when the issue took place. By default, this is set to the current date and time.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">User Contact</span>: A read-only field giving your user name. This will appear in MainBoss's accounting history to show who recorded the issue.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Storage Assignment</span>: A storeroom assignment record indicating the item issued and storeroom from which it was taken. For more on storeroom assignment records, see <a href="StoreroomAssignments.htm">Storeroom Assignments</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Issue Code</span>: The code to be used for this issue. For more on issue codes, see <a href="ItemIssueCodes.htm">Item Issue Codes</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Employee</span>: The person to whom the item was issued. This should be someone from your <span class="CPanel">Employees</span> table. For more, see <a href="Employees.htm">Employees</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Quantity</span>: The quantity being issued.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">On Hand</span>: Read-only fields giving the quantity that will remain in the storeroom after the issue takes place, plus the cost of that quantity.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Calculated On Hand Cost</span>: Read-only fields giving the expected cost of "<span class="CField">Quantity</span>" as calculated from existing price information.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Use calculated On Hand cost</span>: If you checkmark this box, MainBoss will fill in the "<span class="CField">This Entry</span>" line with figures calculated from the costs given in the "<span class="CField">On Hand</span>" line. Otherwise, you must fill in "<span class="CField">This Entry</span>" yourself.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">This Entry</span>: The cost of the given "<span class="CField">Quantity</span>". You can fill in the "<span class="CField">Unit Cost</span>" column (the cost of a single unit of the item) or the "<span class="CField">Total Cost</span>" (the total cost of the adjustment). Whichever column you fill in, MainBoss automatically fills in the other column. If you checkmark <span class="CButton">Use calculated On Hand cost</span>, MainBoss automatically fills in both columns.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">As Corrected</span>: If there has been a correction for this record, this line will have read-only fields giving the corrected values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">From Cost Center</span>, <span class="CField">To Cost Center</span>: Read-only fields telling the cost centers involved in this operation. MainBoss creates accounting records indicating the transfer of money from the first cost center to the second. These fields are only visible if your database has an <span class="BL">Accounting</span> license key. For more, see <a href="AccountingFacilities.htm">Accounting Facilities</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
