<p>A storeroom is any location where you keep inventory materials. If you have more than one storeroom, it's obviously important to know which storeroom contains which items so that workers can find the materials they need.</p>

<p>Before you create a storeroom record, you should create a unit or location record for the room. Here's an example:</p>

<ol><li>Create a <span class="CPanel">Units</span> record for Room 101.</li>
<li>Create a <span class="CPanel">Storerooms</span> record specifying that Room 101 is an inventory storeroom.
</li></ol><p>A storeroom can contain subunits or sublocations. For example, if you number the bins or shelves within a storeroom, each bin or shelf can be a subunit of the storeroom itself. If you specify that a particular unit is a storeroom, all the subunits are considered valid possibilities for <span class="NewTerm">storeroom assignments</span>. For more, see <a href="StoreroomAssignments.htm">Storeroom Assignments</a>.</p>

<p><span class="CInset">Permanent vs. Temporary Storage</span><span class="CInset">:</span> Storerooms are considered <span class="NewTerm">permanent</span> storage facilities. MainBoss also has the concept of <span class="NewTerm">temporary</span> storage facilities&#8212;places where items are stored for short periods of time in preparation for being used on a job. For more information, see <a href="Edit.Temporary%20Storage.htm">Temporary Storage Locations</a>.</p>

<p><span class="CInset">Physical Count Sheet Sort Order</span><span class="CInset">:</span> A <span class="NewTerm">physical count sheet</span> is a print-out designed to help you perform a physical inventory count. Each storeroom record may have a <span class="NewTerm">sort order</span> number that determines where the storeroom will appear in a physical count sheet. For example, a storeroom numbered 1 would appear first on the count sheet; a storeroom numbered 2 would appear second, and so on. (More precisely, the storerooms are sorted from lowest sort order number to highest, even if the lowest number isn't 1 and if some of the numbers aren't consecutive.)</p>
