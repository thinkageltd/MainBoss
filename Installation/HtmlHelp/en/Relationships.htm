<p>Relationships specify connections between pairs of units or between a unit and a contact person. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul class="b1"><li>Unit X is a piece of equipment whose operator is Contact A</li>
<li>Unit X is a piece of equipment leased from Contact B</li>
<li>Unit X is an office suite leased by Contact C</li>
<li>Unit X is an office suite cleaned by Contact D</li>
<li>Unit X is a water heater that supplies hot water for Units A, B, C...</li>
<li>Unit X is the HVAC unit for Units A, B, C... (all of which are offices)</li>
<li>Unit X is a washroom shared by occupants of Units A, B, C...
</li></ul><p>When you create a relationship record, you specify two English phrases for what the relationship means. For example, a relationship between a unit and a contact person might say that:</p>

<ul class="b1"><li>The unit <span class="BL">is leased by</span> the contact person</li>
<li>The contact person <span class="BL">leases</span> the unit
</li></ul><p>You define relationships in <span class="CPanel">Coding Definitions</span> | <span class="CPanel">Relationships</span>. For example, you might set up a relationship record with the phrases <span class="CU">is leased by</span> and <span class="CU">leases</span>, and give that relationship record the identification code <span class="CU">Unit Leasing</span>. With any particular unit, you could then state that the unit has the defined relationship with one or more contact people.</p>

<p>The relationships of a unit are listed in the <span class="CButton">Related</span> section of the unit's record. Similarly, the relationships of a person are listed in the <span class="CButton">Related</span> section of the contact record. Each unit and each contact person may be related to any number of units. They may have the same relationship with multiple units, and they may have different relationships with the same unit.</p>

<p>There are currently the following types of relationships:</p>

<ul class="b1"><li>Unit-to-unit relationships. For more, see <a href="Edit.Unit Related Unit.htm">Unit-to-Unit Relationships</a>.</li>
<li>Unit-to-contact relationships. For more, see <a href="Edit.Unit Related Contact.htm">Unit-to-Contact Relationships</a>.
</li></ul><p>For information on viewing relationship records, see <a href="Browse.Relationship.htm">Viewing Relationship Records</a>. For printing relationship records, see <a href="Report.Relationship.htm">Printing Relationship Records</a>.</p>
