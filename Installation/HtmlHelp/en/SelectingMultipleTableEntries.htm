<p>Many table viewers let you select multiple records from the table. To do this, you use the standard Windows conventions:</p>

<ul class="b1"><li>If you hold down the <span class="CKey">&lt;Shift&gt;</span> key, click on one record, then click on another, you will select both records and all the records in between.</li>
<li>If you hold down the <span class="CKey">&lt;Ctrl&gt;</span> key and click on a record, you select that record. If you hold down <span class="CKey">&lt;Ctrl&gt;</span> and click a different record, you select that record and the first record stays selected. In this way, you can use <span class="CKey">&lt;Ctrl+Click&gt;</span> to select any number of separate records.
</li></ul><p class="box">In many cases, these techniques can also be used to select multiple entries in drop-down lists.</p>

<p>After you select multiple records, you can perform the following operations:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="Delete.png" alt="Delete" /></span>: Deletes the selected records. A window will open to ask if you really want to delete those records.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="Edit.png" alt="Edit" /></span>: Opens the first selected record in an editor window. This window offers you all the features available in a normal editor window for this type of record. In addition, it has a <span class="CButton">Next</span> button; if you click <span class="CButton">Next</span>, MainBoss closes the current window and opens one where you can edit the next record that you selected from the table viewer. By repeatedly clicking <span class="CButton">Next</span>, you can move through the records that you selected, editing each one as you wish.

<br /><br />If you use the editor window to change the contents of a record, the <span class="CButton">Next</span> button disappears until you click <span class="CButton">Save</span> (to save your changes) or <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> (to cancel the changes). You will not be able to go to the next record until you save or cancel your changes.

<br /><br /><span class="CButton">Next</span> is a drop-down button with the following entries:</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Previous</span>: Closes the current window and opens an editor window to edit the previous record from the list of selected records. By using <span class="CButton">Next</span> and <span class="CButton">Previous</span>, you can go forward and backward through the list of selected records.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the current window and goes back to the table viewer. This says that you are finished using <span class="CButton">Next</span> and <span class="CButton">Previous</span> to edit the selected records.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Works like the usual <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button, canceling any changes you have made.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">View</span>: Works exactly like <span class="CButton"><img src="Edit.png" alt="Edit" /></span> except that you can only look at the contents of the selected records, not make changes. You can use <span class="CButton">Next</span> and <span class="CButton">Previous</span> buttons to go forward and backward through the list of selected records.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Restore</span>: Is only enabled if the records you have selected are all currently deleted. If so, MainBoss opens an editor window that works exactly like <span class="CButton"><img src="Edit.png" alt="Edit" /></span>. If you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the current record, it will be restored. You can use <span class="CButton">Next</span> and <span class="CButton">Previous</span> to move forward and backward through the list of selected records.</p>
