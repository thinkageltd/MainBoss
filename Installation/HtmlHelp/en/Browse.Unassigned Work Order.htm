<p><span class="CPanel">My Assignment Overview</span> | <span class="CPanel">Open Work Orders</span> | <span class="CPanel">Unassigned Work Orders</span> lists any work orders that are in the Draft or Open state but do not have anybody assigned to them. The window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Priority</span>: Click this heading to sort the list by priority. Click again to reverse the order.</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="Edit.png" alt="Edit" /></span>: This drop-down button offers several possible actions:</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Edit</span>: Opens an editor window to let you edit the selected record.</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Self Assign</span>: Clicking this button lets you assign yourself to a selected work order. MainBoss will open a window for creating a state history record; this record will indicate that you claimed the work order for yourself. It will also let you specify comments, a status code, and other information. For more on state history records, see <a href="Edit.Work%20Order%20State%20History.htm">Editing Work Order State History Records</a>.

<br /><br />Once you save the state history record, your name will be added to the work order's <span class="CButton">Assignments</span> section. The work order will disappear from the <span class="CPanel">Unassigned Work Orders</span> list because the work order now has an assignment.</p>
<p class="wi">State change actions: A drop-down button which offers a list of actions that can be used to change the state of the work order. The current state of the work order determines which actions are enabled; it also determines which action is displayed as the label for the button. In the open work order viewer, the only enabled state-change actions are:</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Open</span>: Changes a draft work order into an open one. This action is only enabled for draft work orders.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Open Work Order (With Comment)</span>: Same as <span class="CButton">Open</span>, except that MainBoss will also open a window where you can record a comment about what you're doing.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Close Work Order</span>: Changes an open work order into a closed one. This action is only enabled for open work orders.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Close Work Order (With Comment)</span>: Same as <span class="CButton">Close Work Order</span>, except that MainBoss will also open a window where you can record a comment about what you're doing.</p>
<p class="box">If you have specified the appropriate request transition options, closing a work order automatically closes each linked request, provided that each request only has one linked work order. For more on this option, see <a href="Edit.Work%20Order%20Request%20Transition.htm">Specifying Request State Transitions</a>.</p>

<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Re-Draft</span>: Changes an open work order into a draft one. This action is only enabled for open work orders.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Void</span>: Changes a draft work order into a void one, thereby canceling it. This action is only enabled for draft work orders.</p>

<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Find Next</span>: Uses the same search condition(s) as your most recent search and finds the next record in the table that matches the condition(s).

<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Find Previous</span>: Same as <span class="CButton">Find Next</span> except that it goes backward in the table. If the search reaches the start of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the end of the table and continues the search.</p>
