<p>Task temporary storage assignments specify an item and a temporary storage location that might be used to hold that item during planned maintenance tasks. For example, you might specify that every time you do a 3000-mile check-up on a vehicle, various materials (like engine oil, air filters, etc.) should be put out on a particular work bench so they'll be available if needed. The work bench is the temporary storage that can be used in such tasks.</p>

<p class="box">For more on temporary storage assignments during work orders, see <a href="Edit.Temporary%20Storage.htm">Temporary Storage Locations</a>. For more on task temporary storage locations, see <a href="Edit.Task%20Temporary%20Storage.htm">Editing Task Temporary Storage Locations</a>.</p>

<p>Before you can create a task temporary storage assignment, you must first associate a temporary storage location with the task. Then you click <span class="CButton">New Task Temporary Storage Assignment</span> in the <span class="CButton">Task Temporary Storage</span> section of the task record. This opens a window that contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Item</span>: The inventory item whose location you're recording. For more on inventory items, see <a href="InventoryItemRecords.htm">Inventory Item Records</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Location</span>: A temporary storage location. This must already be a temporary storage location associated with the task.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Item Price</span>: A price or price quote on the item. Typically, this is used to indicate the vendor from whom you prefer to purchase the item. For more on item pricing, see <a href="Edit.Item%20Pricing.htm">Item Pricing</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
