<p>You create or modify requests using the request editor. The usual way to open the editor is to click <span class="CButton">New Request</span> or <span class="CButton">Edit</span> in the <span class="CButton">View</span> section of <span class="CPanel">Requests</span>. However, you can also get to this window by clicking <span class="CButton">Edit Defaults</span> in the <span class="CButton">Defaults for Requests</span> section of the <span class="CPanel">Requests</span> viewer.</p>

<p>The request editor window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Details</span> section: Shows basic information for the record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Number</span>: A code identifying this work request. No two requests may have the same code.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Subject</span>: A subject line that briefly states the nature of the problem.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Number Format</span> [only appears when editing defaults]: Specifies the format to be used when numbering new requests. The default is <span class="CU">WR {0:D8}</span>. This means that the numbering format consists of the letters <span class="CU">WR</span> followed by a space and then eight decimal digits.

<br /><br />The <span class="CU">0</span> before the <span class="CU">:</span> is necessary. The number after the <span class="CU">D</span> is the minimum number of decimal digits in the resulting number. As an example, suppose you want to include the year in your request numbers. If you set "<span class="CField">Number Format</span>" to <span class="CU">Req 2007-{0:D6}</span>, you'll get numbers like <span class="CU">Req 2007-000001</span>. You can also put text after the closing <span class="CU">}</span>; for example, you could write <span class="CU">Req {0:D6}-2007 </span>to get numbers like <span class="CU">Req 000001-2007</span>.

<br /><br />For more on number formats, see <a href="NumberFormats.htm">Number Formats</a>.</p>
<p class="box">We recommend that you use enough digits in your numbers to ensure that there is always a leading zero.</p>

<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Number Sequence</span> [only appears when editing defaults]: Specifies the number to used the next time you create a new request. For example, if you set this to 1000, the next request you create will be given the number 1000.</p>
<p class="box">If you include the year in "<span class="CField">Number Format</span>", you should change the format at the beginning of each year and reset "<span class="CField">Number Sequence</span>" to 1.</p>

<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Current</span>: Read-only fields indicating the request's current status.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CField">Effective Date</span>: The date/time that the request entered its current state.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CField">State</span>: Whether the request is New (recently created), In Progress (accepted by the maintenance department), Void (rejected by the maintenance department or otherwise cancelled), or Closed (marked as complete).</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CField">Status</span>: A user-defined status code for this request. Typically, a code means that the request requires someone's attention. For more on request statuses, see <a href="RequestStatusCodes.htm">Request Status Codes</a>.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CField">Estimated Completion Date</span>: A read-only field telling when the job is expected to be completed. This date is taken from information specified when you change the state of the request; for example, when you mark a request as "in progress", you have a chance to specify the estimated completion date. The date shown in this field is taken from the most recent <span class="NewTerm">state history change</span> record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Requestor</span>: The person who submitted the work request (and the person's phone number). You specify this person by referring to (or creating) an entry in the <span class="CPanel">Requestors</span> table. For more about requestors, see <a href="Requestors.htm">Requestors</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Unit</span>: The unit where the work is needed. For more on units, see <a href="Units.htm">Units</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Use Access Code from Unit</span>: If this is checkmarked, MainBoss will fill in "<span class="CField">Access Code</span>" with the default access code associated with the unit. If this is blank, you can fill in "<span class="CField">Access Code</span>" with any available code.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Access Code</span>: An access code indicating any restrictions on access to the unit. For more on access codes, see <a href="AccessCodes.htm">Access Codes</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Priority</span>: A code indicating the priority of this job. For more on priorities, see <a href="RequestPriorities.htm">Request Priorities</a>.</p>
<p class="box">Requests with explicit priorities are considered more urgent than requests where the priority field is blank. Therefore, if you sort your requests by priority, those with no explicit priority will come last.</p>

<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Description</span>: A more detailed description of the problem.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Comments</span>: Any additional comments that may be useful to maintenance personnel.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Select for Printing</span>: If this box is checkmarked, the request will be marked <span class="CButton">Select for Printing</span>. This makes it simpler to print requests after they have been generated. For more on the use of <span class="CButton">Select for Printing</span>, see <a href="SelectPrintFlags.htm">Select Print Flags</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Assignments</span> section: Lists people who have been assigned to this request. For more information on assignments, see <a href="Assignments.htm">Assignments</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">New Request Assignment</span>: Opens a window where you can assign someone to this request. For more details, see <a href="Edit.Request%20Assignment.htm">Assigning Someone to a Request</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Edit.png" alt="Edit" /></span>: This drop-down button offers several possible actions:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Edit</span>: Opens an editor window to let you edit the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">View</span>: Opens an editor window where you can examine the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">View Assignee</span>: Opens a window where you can view the request assignee record associated with the assignment that's currently selected.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Delete.png" alt="Delete" /></span>: Deletes the selected assignment from the list.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span>: Lets you search through the list of records for a particular record. For more information, see <a href="Search.htm">Searching for a Particular Record</a>. The <span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span> button has an accompanying drop-down list containing the following:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Find Next</span>: Uses the same search condition(s) as your most recent search and finds the next record in the table that matches the condition(s). If the search reaches the end of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the start of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Find Previous</span>: Same as <span class="CButton">Find Next</span> except that it goes backward in the table. If the search reaches the start of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the end of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Email Request</span> section: If this request originated from an email message, this will list the contents of the message. (Email requests are only possible if you have licensed the MainBoss Service module.)</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Receive Date</span>: Date the email was received.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Sender Email Address</span>: Email address that sent the request.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Mail Message</span>: The text of the email message.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Comments</span>: Any comments that the maintenance department might have about the email. (These comments are not sent to the requestor.)</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Work Orders</span> section: Lists information about work orders associated with this request. Note that this section has no <span class="CButton">New</span> button. If you want to associate a new work order with this request, use <span class="CButton">New Work Order</span> at the bottom of window. If you want to associate an existing work order with the request, use <span class="CButton">Link Work Orders</span>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Work Order</span>: Click on this heading to sort the list by work order number. Click again to reverse the order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Work Order Unit</span>: Click on this heading to sort the list by unit. Click again to reverse the order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Work Order Subject</span>: Click on this heading to sort the list by subject line. Click again to reverse the order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Edit.png" alt="Edit" /></span>: This drop-down button offers several possible actions:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Edit</span>: Opens a window where you can edit the link to the work order. Note that you aren't editing the actual work order, just the information linking this request to the work order.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">View</span>: Opens an editor window where you can examine the selected link to a work order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Delete.png" alt="Delete" /></span>: Deletes the selected work order from the list. The work order will still exist, but it will no longer be associated with this request.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span>: Opens a window to search for a particular work order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">State History</span> section: Lists the states that this request has been in and the date/times when the request entered each state.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Effective Date</span>: Shows the effective date/time when the request entered the associated state. Effective date can be set manually by clicking the associated <span class="CButton">Edit</span> button.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">State</span>: Shows the states through which the request has passed.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Status</span>: Shows the status codes through which the request has passed.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Comments</span>: Shows any comments associated with each state history record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Edit.png" alt="Edit" /></span>: This drop-down button offers several possible actions:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Edit</span>: Opens a window to edit the selected state history record. For more, see <a href="Edit.Request%20State%20History.htm">Editing Request State History Records</a>.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">View</span>: Opens an editor window where you can examine the selected state history record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span>: Opens a window to search for a particular record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close Preferences</span> section [only appears when editing defaults]: Specifies what MainBoss should do in situations where requests are linked with work orders. You can link a request to a work order using the <span class="CButton">Link Work Orders</span> button. Alternatively, if you create a work order from a request using the <span class="CButton">New Work Order</span> button, the request is automatically linked to the new work order.

<br /><br />When a request is linked to a work order, changes in the work order's state can affect the request's state. For example, you could tell MainBoss that every time you close a work order, MainBoss should automatically close all the requests linked to that work order.

<br /><br />The <span class="CButton">Close Preferences</span> section of the <span class="CButton">Defaults for Requests</span> window lets you control what MainBoss does in such situations.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Requests are automatically changed to a new state when linked to a work order, or when a linked work order state changes</span>: If this checkbox is blank, MainBoss does <span class="Emphasis">not</span> change a request's state automatically. No matter what happens to work orders, the state of a request does not change unless you change the state by hand.

<br /><br />If the box is checkmarked, MainBoss will automatically change request states in response to state changes in linked work orders. The table below the checkbox lists when and how the request states will be changed.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Include Work Order History status code and comments in Comments to Requestor</span>: When a work order is closed, and the work order was originally created from a request, MainBoss can send acknowledgment email messages to the original requestor, indicating that the request has been satisfied. (You must have licensed the <span class="BL">Web Requests</span> module in order for this to happen.) If you checkmark <span class="CButton">Include Work Order History status code and comments in Comments to Requestor</span>, the acknowledgment message will include any comments and status codes that were associated with the work order. If you leave the checkbox blank, the acknowledgment message won't include this information.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">New Work Order Request Transition</span>: Lets you specify rules for changing request states when a linked work order changes its state. For more information, see <a href="Edit.Work%20Order%20Request%20Transition.htm">Specifying Request State Transitions</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Edit.png" alt="Edit" /></span>: This drop-down button offers several possible actions:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Edit</span>: Opens a window where you can edit the selected request transition.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">View</span>: Opens an editor window where you can examine the selected request transition.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Delete.png" alt="Delete" /></span>: Deletes the selected request transition from the list.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span>: Opens a window to search for a particular request transition.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Print</span>: Saves the current record and opens a window for printing this request.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="PrintHS.png" alt="Print" /></span>: Opens a window for printing this request.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save Defaults</span> [only appears when editing defaults]: Saves the current set of default values. The window stays open in case you want to make any more changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close Request</span>: Closes the currently selected work request. <span class="CButton">Close Request</span> also has the following drop-down choices:</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Close Request (With Comment)</span>: Closes the selected request, and also opens a window where you can record a comment about what you're doing.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Reopen</span>: Reopens a request that has been closed or voided. MainBoss will also open a window where you may record a comment explaining why you're reopening the request.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">In Progress</span>: Marks the request as "in progress".</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">In Progress (With Comment)</span>: Marks the request as "in progress". MainBoss will also open a window where you can record a comment about what you're doing.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Void</span>: Cancels the selected request. MainBoss will also open a window where you can record a comment explaining why you are canceling the request.</p>
<p class="box">As noted above, some of the "state-change" operations open a window where you can record comments about what you're doing. This window also gives you an opportunity to record comments to be sent to the original requestor. If you have the MainBoss Service module, these comments are automatically emailed to the requestor. The comments are also recorded in the request's <span class="CButton">State History</span> section. For further information, see <a href="Edit.Request%20State%20History.htm">Editing Request State History Records</a>.</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Link Work Orders</span>: Lets you indicate that this request is associated with an existing work order. This is useful if you get several requests reporting the same problem. The first time someone submits a particular complaint, you can use <span class="CButton">New Work Order</span> to make a work order to fix the problem. If other people complain about the same thing, you can use <span class="CButton">Link Work Orders</span> to associate their requests with the work order you've already created. This makes it easier to keep track of which requests are associated with which work orders.

<br /><br />Note that it's also possible for a single request to be associated with multiple work orders. For example, you might create one work order for a short-term work-around fix, and another work order for a more permanent repair. Using <span class="CButton">Link Work Orders</span> lets you associate the request with both work orders.

<br /><br />A request may be linked to any number of work orders and vice versa. When you click <span class="CButton">Link Work Orders</span>, you get the window described in <a href="Edit.Requested%20Work%20Order.htm">Requested Work Orders</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">New Work Order</span>: Opens a window that lets you create a work order based on this request. Information from the request will be copied into the new work order; however, this information can be changed if desired. For more on creating and editing work orders, see <a href="Edit.Work%20Order.htm">Editing Work Orders</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">New Requestor Comment</span>: Lets you record a comment for the requestor. If you have the MainBoss Service module, this comment will be automatically emailed to the requestor. If not, you will have to convey the comment to the requestor in some other way.

<br /><br />You can click <span class="CButton">New Requestor Comment</span> on a request as often as you like; each time, MainBoss will give you a chance to record a comment about the request. <span class="CButton">New Requestor Comment</span> therefore gives you a good way to keep track of problems, delays, and other special situations that arise during the course of a request, and to keep the requestor informed about these situations.

<br /><br />Each requestor comment is recorded in the request's <span class="CButton">State History</span> section. For more on state histories, see <a href="Edit.Request%20State%20History.htm">Editing Request State History Records</a>.</p>
