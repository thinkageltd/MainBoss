<p>When you first start using MainBoss Solo, you see the <span class="NewTerm">setup</span> window. This window contains a number of buttons that perform very basic MainBoss operations.</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Start</span>: Starts a MainBoss Solo session.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Create</span>: Creates a MainBoss database. The database is always created in the file <span class="CU">Documents\MainBoss\MainBossSolo.mdf</span>. (If you have an older version of Windows, Solo uses <span class="CU">"My Documents"</span> instead of "<span class="CU">Documents"</span>.)

<br /><br />If you already have a database in the given file, the <span class="CButton">Create</span> button is disabled&#8212;you cannot create a new database if you already have one.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Delete</span>: Deletes your current MainBoss database file. All data in the database file will be erased. Obviously, you should never use <span class="CButton">Delete</span> if your database contains anything you want to keep; however, you might use <span class="CButton">Delete</span> if you have simply been experimenting with Solo and want to start over from scratch. You might also use <span class="CButton">Delete</span> if you intend to <span class="CButton">Restore</span> your database from a backup.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Restore</span>: Overwrites the current contents of your database (if any) with data stored in a backup file. All current contents of the database will be lost.

<br /><br />In order to use <span class="CButton">Restore</span>, you must have an existing backup file made using MainBoss's backup facilities. For more information, see <a href="Browse.Backup.htm">Backups</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Update License</span>: Opens a window where you can enter a new license key for your software. Licenses for Solo typically last a year. As you approach the expiry date, Solo warns you that your license will soon expire; after the expiry date, you cannot <span class="CButton">Start</span> Solo until you obtain a new license.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Upgrade</span>: Upgrades your database after you have installed a new version of Solo.

<br /><br />Installing new software usually happens automatically&#8212;whenever you start Solo, the startup software checks to see if a new version is available, and if so, the startup software automatically installs the new version. Sometimes, a new version will introduce features that necessitate changes in the database file; if so, Solo will tell you that you need to <span class="CButton">Upgrade</span> your database. At any other time, the <span class="CButton">Upgrade</span> button will be disabled. This indicates that upgrading isn't needed.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Copy Shortcut</span>: Creates a shortcut icon for Solo on your Windows desktop. Under normal conditions, this is only necessary once. However, if a new version of Solo is installed, you may need to create a new shortcut that refers to the new version.</p>
<p>If you are already using Solo and want to return to the setup window, you can do so by going to the <span class="CMenu">Session</span> menu and clicking <span class="CMenu">Setup</span>.</p>
