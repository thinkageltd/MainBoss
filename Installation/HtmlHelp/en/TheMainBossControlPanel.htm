<p>When you first start MainBoss, you'll see a window that has the MainBoss <span class="NewTerm">control panel</span> on its left-hand side. This control panel looks much like the list of folders on the left-hand side of Windows Explorer. The window that contains the control panel is the most important window used in MainBoss.</p>

<p>The MainBoss control panel organizes MainBoss operations and provides access to them. For example, the <span class="CPanel">Requests</span> entry provides access to operations related to work requests. Clicking <span class="CPanel">Requests</span> itself lets you see a list of current work requests. This list is shown in the right half of the window. The right half of the window also has buttons that let you create new work requests, edit existing requests, and so on.</p>

<p>Clicking a + sign in the control panel displays further MainBoss operations (just as clicking the + in a Windows Explorer folder displays subfolders). For example, the <span class="CPanel">Requests</span> entry has several subentries, including <span class="CPanel">Reports</span>. Clicking the + on this <span class="CPanel">Reports</span> will provide a list of reports related to work requests.</p>

<p class="box">The MainBoss control panel is your starting point for almost all MainBoss data and operations. Looking at entries in the control panel is one way to learn what MainBoss can do.</p>

<p>Right-clicking on an entry in the control panel brings up a menu of operations that can be performed on the associated table. Different control panel entries have different menus. In general, however, the menu contains entries for printing the associated table, selecting entries in the table, and expanding or collapsing entries that have sub-entries (e.g. the <span class="CPanel">Units</span> table, where units may have sub-units).</p>
