<p>In a work order, chargeback activities provide an itemized list of charges being transferred to a third party. For example, you might have a line for each worker who participated in the job, indicating how much will be charged for each worker. Similarly, you might have a line for each spare part and other materials used in the job.</p>

<p>The charges specified in a chargeback activity record may or may not be the same as the maintenance department's actual costs. For example, a property management company may charge tenants a fixed rate for each worker's time, no matter how much the workers are actually paid. Chargeback activities state the charges, not the actual costs. (Actual costs are given in the <span class="CButton">Resources</span> section of a work order; for more, see <a href="Resources.htm">Resources</a>.)</p>

<p>To record chargeback activities, you start in the <span class="CButton">Chargebacks</span> section of a work order. Use <span class="CButton">New Chargeback</span> to create a main chargeback record (which identifies who will pay the charges). In the main chargeback record, click <span class="CButton">New Chargeback Activity</span> in the <span class="CButton">Chargeback Activity</span> section to create new chargeback activities. The window for editing chargeback activities contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Entry Date</span>: A read-only field giving the date that this record was created.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Effective Date</span>: The date/time of the charge. For example, if this chargeback is for a part, the date/time on which the part was used. By default, this is set to the current date/time.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">User Contact</span>: A read-only field giving your name. This will appear in MainBoss's accounting history to show who made the chargeback.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Chargeback</span>: A read-only field giving the work order, the chargeback, and the billable requestor.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Chargeback Line Category</span>: A classification for this chargeback activity. For more, see <a href="ChargebackCategories.htm">Chargeback Categories</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Comments</span>: Any internal comments you want to associate with this chargeback.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">This Entry</span>: The cost of this chargeback.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">As Corrected</span>: Only used when an existing chargeback activity is being corrected.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">From Cost Center</span>, <span class="CField">To Cost Center</span>: Read-only fields telling the cost centers involved in this operation. MainBoss creates accounting records indicating the transfer of money from the first cost center to the second. These fields are only visible if your database has an <span class="BL">Accounting</span> license key. For more, see <a href="AccountingFacilities.htm">Accounting Facilities</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
