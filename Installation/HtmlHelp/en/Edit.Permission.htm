<p>A <span class="NewTerm">permission</span> is associated with the ability to view and/or change parts of the MainBoss database. Every security role has one or more associated permissions, indicating what someone with that role is permitted to do. You assign permissions to a security role using the <span class="CButton">New Permission</span> button in the <span class="CButton">Permissions</span> section of the security role editor.</p>

<p>Permissions are identified by text strings. For example, the string <span class="CU">Table.Vendor.View</span> is the permission that lets someone view the Vendors table. If you create a new security role for your organization, you will specify one or more permissions for the role. To find out the names of available permissions, look at the <span class="CButton">Permissions</span> section of one of the built-in security roles.</p>

<p class="box"><span class="CInset">Note:</span> Creating a new security role requires significant technical expertise; we recommend that you consult with MainBoss Support before you attempt it. This version of MainBoss doesn't let you change the permissions of built-in security roles, but you can create new roles of your own.</p>

<p>The window for associating a permission with a security role contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi">Security role name: A read-only field giving the name of the security role.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Permission Path Pattern</span>: The permission you want to assign to the role. This is a text string that must be in exactly the correct format expected by MainBoss. For help, see the permissions associated with the built-in security roles.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
