<p>The <span class="CPanel">Locations</span> table stores information on all locations used in your work. This includes buildings, storerooms, addresses of vendors, and even the locations of the units you maintain.</p>

<p>The simplest type of location is a <span class="NewTerm">postal address</span>. A record for a postal address stores all the usual address information&#8212;street address, city, country, etc.</p>

<p>A <span class="NewTerm">sublocation</span> is a location inside another location. For example, suppose you have a postal address record representing an office building. You might create sublocation records for each floor inside that building. You might then create more sublocations for office suites on each floor; these records are <span class="NewTerm">inside</span> the individual floor records. You could also create records for each room inside each office suite, and so on.</p>

<p>This set-up is similar to the way that folders under Windows can contain subfolders, which can contain other subfolders, which can contain individual files. When MainBoss displays the Locations table, you'll see a picture of what contains what in the same way that Windows Explorer shows the structure of your folders and files. This is called a <span class="NewTerm">location map</span>.</p>

<p class="box">In practice, you set up one or more postal address records first, then define locations within each postal address.</p>

<p>Location records are used extensively throughout MainBoss Advanced. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul class="b1"><li>A contact record can have an associated location record giving that contact's address information. The same goes for personnel records.</li>
<li>A unit record has a location record telling where the unit is.</li>
<li>An item record can have multiple locations associated with it, indicating places where the item is stored (i.e. what MainBoss Basic called storerooms).
</li></ul><p>In addition to the types of locations already discussed, MainBoss allows a number of other location types:</p>

<ul class="b1"><li>Units may be considered locations. For example, you can talk about the location of a piece of equipment; for more, see <a href="Units.htm">Units</a>.</li>
<li><span class="NewTerm">Temporary storage locations</span> are places where spare parts and other materials may be stored before and during a specific job. For more, see <a href="Edit.Temporary Storage.htm">Temporary Storage Locations</a>.</li>
<li><span class="NewTerm">Temporary storage locations for tasks</span> are places where spare parts and other materials may be stored every time you do a planned maintenance task. For more, see <a href="Edit.Task Temporary Storage Assignment.htm">Editing Task Temporary Storage Assignments</a>.</li>
<li><span class="NewTerm">Storerooms</span> are locations where spare parts and other materials may be stored in the long term (as opposed to just for a single job). For more, see <a href="Storerooms.htm">Storerooms</a>.
