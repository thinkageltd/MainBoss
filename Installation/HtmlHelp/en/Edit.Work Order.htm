<p>You create or modify work orders using the work order editor. The usual way to open the editor is to click <span class="CButton">New Work Order</span> or <span class="CButton">Edit</span> in the <span class="CButton">View</span> section of <span class="CPanel">Work Orders</span>.</p>

<p>The work order editor window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Details</span> section: Shows basic information for the work order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Number</span>: A code identifying this work order. No two work orders may have the same code.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Number Format</span> [only appears when editing defaults]: Specifies the format to be used when numbering new work orders. The default is <span class="CU">WO {0:D8}</span>. This means that the numbering format consists of the letters <span class="CU">WO</span> followed by a space and then eight decimal digits.

<br /><br />The <span class="CU">0</span> before the <span class="CU">:</span> is necessary. The number after the <span class="CU">D</span> is the minimum number of decimal digits in the resulting number. As an example, suppose you want to include the year in your work orders numbers. If you set "<span class="CField">Number Format</span>" to <span class="CU">WO 2007-{0:D6}</span>, you'll get numbers like <span class="CU">WO 2007-000001</span>. You can also put text after the closing <span class="CU">}</span>; for example, you could write <span class="CU">WO {0:D6}-2007 </span>to get numbers like <span class="CU">WO 000001-2007</span>.

<br /><br />For more on number formats, see <a href="NumberFormats.htm">Number Formats</a>.</p>
<p class="box">We recommend that you use enough digits in your numbers to ensure that there is always a leading zero.</p>

<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Number Sequence</span> [only appears when editing defaults]: Specifies the number to used the next time you create a new work order. For example, if you set this to 1000, the next work order you create will be given the number 1000.</p>
<p class="box">If you include the year in "<span class="CField">Number Format</span>", you should change the format at the beginning of each year and reset "<span class="CField">Number Sequence</span>" to 1.</p>

<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Subject</span>: A brief description of what the associated work involves.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Current</span>: Read-only fields indicating the work order's current status.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CField">Effective Date</span>: The date/time that the work order entered its current state.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CField">State</span>: Whether the work order is Draft (recently created), Open (ready to go), Void (cancelled), or Closed (marked as complete). A new work order's "<span class="CField">State</span>" is blank until the first time the work order is saved.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CField">Status</span>: A user-defined status code for this work order. Typically, a code means that the work order requires someone's attention. For more on work order status codes, see <a href="WorkOrderStatusCodes.htm">Work Order Status Codes</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">PM Generation Batch</span>: A read-only field which is blank unless this work order was generated as a planned maintenance work order. If the work order <span class="Emphasis">was</span> generated for planned maintenance, "<span class="CField">PM Generation Batch</span>" shows information about the dates when the work order was generated. For more information, see <a href="PlannedMaintenance.htm">Planned Maintenance</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Requestor</span>: The person who originally requested the work. If this work order was derived from a work request, the requestor will be taken from the original request.

<br /><br />Requestors cannot be named in a work order until they have an entry in the <span class="CPanel">Requestors</span> table. For more about this table, see <a href="Requestors.htm">Requestors</a>.

<br /><br />Once you specify a requestor, this line will display the person's phone number and email address (as recorded in the <span class="CPanel">Contacts</span> table).</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Unit</span>: The unit where the work is needed. For more on units, see <a href="Units.htm">Units</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Work Start Date</span>: When a work order is first created, this may be filled in with the date/time when the job is expected to begin.

<br /><br />If a job doesn't actually begin on the specified date, it may be useful to leave "<span class="CField">Work Start Date</span>" as it is. Later on, this can let you determine the difference between the planned start date and the actual one; such information can help you detect any systematic problems with your scheduling processes.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Work End Date</span>: When a work order is first created, this may be filled in with the date/time when the job is expected to be finished.

<br /><br />If a job doesn't actually end on the specified date, it may be useful to leave "<span class="CField">Work End Date</span>" as it is. Later on, this can let you determine the difference between the planned end date and the actual one; such information can help you detect any systematic problems with your job-length estimation processes.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Duration</span>: The length of the job, measured in days.</p>
<p class="box"><span class="CInset">Note:</span> If you fill in "<span class="CField">Work Start Date</span>" and "<span class="CField">Work End Date</span>", MainBoss automatically calculates the "<span class="CField">Duration</span>" and fills in the value (rounded to the nearest whole number of days). Similarly, if you fill in "<span class="CField">Work Start Date</span>" and "<span class="CField">Duration</span>", MainBoss automatically calculates the "<span class="CField">Work End Date</span>".</p>

<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Work Category</span>: A code classifying the nature of the work required. For more on work categories, see <a href="WorkCategories.htm">Work Categories</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Use Access Code from Unit</span>: If you checkmark this box, MainBoss will fill in "<span class="CField">Access Code</span>" with the unit's default access code. Otherwise, you can set "<span class="CField">Access Code</span>" manually.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Access Code</span>: An access code indicating any restrictions on access to the unit. For more on access codes, see <a href="AccessCodes.htm">Access Codes</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Priority</span>: A code indicating the priority of this job. Note that work orders and work requests have separate priority codes. A good rule of thumb is to leave <span class="CField">Priority</span> blank unless there's a good reason for assigning a specific priority. For more on work order priorities, see <a href="WorkOrderPriorities.htm">Work Order Priorities</a>.</p>
<p class="box">Work orders with explicit priorities are considered more urgent than ones where the priority field is blank. Therefore, if you sort your work orders by priority, those with no explicit priority will come last.</p>

<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Use Expense Model from Unit</span>: If you checkmark this box, MainBoss will fill in "<span class="CField">Expense Model</span>" with the unit's default expense model. Otherwise, you can set "<span class="CField">Expense Model</span>" manually.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Expense Model</span>: The expense model to be used for this work order. For more on expense models, see <a href="ExpenseModels.htm">Expense Models</a>.</p>
<p class="box"><span class="CInset">Note:</span> You can change a work order's expense model as long as the work order is in the Draft stage. However, this may introduce problems with existing demands. For example, suppose that when you change the expense model, a demand has an expense category that was in the previous expense model but not in the new one. You will not be able to actualize that demand, since its expense category is not valid in the new model.</p>

<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Project</span>: The project (if any) that this work is associated with. For more, see <a href="Projects.htm">Projects</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Description</span>: Describes the required work in as much detail as necessary. Work descriptions may be simple ("Find out why room is too hot") or they may be more detailed, perhaps giving check-lists of things to do or step-by-step instructions.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Comments</span>: Any comments you wish to record in connection with this work order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Downtime</span>: The amount of downtime caused by the problem.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Close Code</span>: Different organizations use the closing code for different purposes. One common purpose is to specify the overall cause of the problem, e.g. normal wear and tear, operator error, accidental breakage, etc. This makes it possible to organize your work orders and their costs according to cause; not only does this give you a picture of the sources of maintenance trouble, it may help you allocate resources more effectively to reduce future difficulties. For more on closing codes, see <a href="ClosingCodes.htm">Closing Codes</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Select for Printing</span>: If this box is checkmarked, the work order will be marked <span class="CButton">Select for Printing</span>. This makes it simpler to print work orders after they have been generated. For more on the use of <span class="CButton">Select for Printing</span>, see <a href="SelectPrintFlags.htm">Select Print Flags</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Assignments</span> section: Lists people who have been assigned to this work order. For more information on assignments, see <a href="Assignments.htm">Assignments</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">New Work Order Assignment</span>: Opens a window where you can assign someone to this work order. For more details, see <a href="Edit.Work%20Order%20Assignment.htm">Assigning Someone to a Work Order</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Edit.png" alt="Edit" /></span>: This drop-down button offers several possible actions:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Edit</span>: Opens an editor window to let you edit the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">View</span>: Opens an editor window where you can examine the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">View Assignee</span>: Opens the currently selected assignee record (if any). For more on work order assignee records, see <a href="WorkOrderAssignees.htm">Work Order Assignees</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Delete.png" alt="Delete" /></span>: Deletes the selected assignment from the list.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span>: Lets you search through the list of records for a particular record. For more information, see <a href="Search.htm">Searching for a Particular Record</a>. The <span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span> button has an accompanying drop-down list containing the following:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Find Next</span>: Uses the same search condition(s) as your most recent search and finds the next record in the table that matches the condition(s). If the search reaches the end of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the start of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Find Previous</span>: Same as <span class="CButton">Find Next</span> except that it goes backward in the table. If the search reaches the start of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the end of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Service Contracts</span> section: Lists any service contracts associated with the specified unit.

<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">View</span>: Opens an editor window where you can examine the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span>: Lets you search through the list of records for a particular record. For more information, see <a href="Search.htm">Searching for a Particular Record</a>. The <span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span> button has an accompanying drop-down list containing the following:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Find Next</span>: Uses the same search condition(s) as your most recent search and finds the next record in the table that matches the condition(s). If the search reaches the end of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the start of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Find Previous</span>: Same as <span class="CButton">Find Next</span> except that it goes backward in the table. If the search reaches the start of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the end of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Resources</span> section: Lists labor and materials associated with this job. These can be either <span class="NewTerm">demands</span>, <span class="NewTerm">receipts</span>, or <span class="NewTerm">actual</span> resource usages.

<br /><br />A demand is recorded in advance of the work. For labor, a demand specifies one or more workers who have been assigned to the job and the time each worker is expected to be needed. For materials, a demand states that specified items should be reserved for use on this job. (For more about demands, see <a href="Resources.htm">Resources</a>.

<br /><br />A receipt records when you've purchased materials during the course of a job. For example, if you purchase items with petty cash in order to make a repair, you should record the expenditure with a receipt on the work order.

<br /><br />Actual resource usages are recorded after the job is done. They state the labor and materials that were actually used in the work, as opposed to the preliminary estimates.

<br /><br />Labor expenses are either <span class="NewTerm">inside</span> and <span class="NewTerm">outside</span>. Inside labor is performed by your own personnel, while outside labor is performed by outside contractors.</p>
<p class="box"><span class="CInset">Note:</span> If you make a mistake when actualizing a demand, you correct the mistake by selecting the demand, then clicking the <span class="CButton">Edit</span> button. In the resulting demand window, use the <span class="CButton">Correct</span> button in the <span class="CButton">Actuals</span> section.</p>

<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Total</span>: Read-only fields giving a running total of demand records and actual records. These totals sum up information from the <span class="CButton">Items</span>, <span class="CButton">Inside</span>, <span class="CButton">Outside</span> and <span class="CButton">Miscellaneous Expenses</span> subsections.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Items</span> subsection: Lists demands and actual uses of materials.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">New Demand Item</span>: Opens a new window where you can reserve materials before the job begins. For more information, see <a href="Edit.Demand%20Item.htm">Demand Item</a>.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Actualize</span>: Opens a new window where you can create an actual resource usage entry from an existing demand entry. You should click the demand first, then click <span class="CButton">Actualize</span>. Typically, actual resource usage records are created as work is completed (when actual resource usage is known). For more about actual item usages, see <a href="Edit.Actual%20Item.htm">Actual Item</a>.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Edit</span>: Lets you edit an existing demand in the list.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">View</span>: Lets you view an entry in the list (without changing any information in the entry).</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">View Storage Assignment</span>: Opens the storeroom assignment record associated with the currently selected entry. While you cannot make changes in the storeroom assignment itself, you can use the record's <span class="CButton">Item Activity</span> section to perform inventory operations such as transferring items to or from the storeroom, and receiving items into the storeroom. For example, if you buy materials for this work order, you can use <span class="CButton">View Storage Assignment</span> to open a storage assignment record for those materials, then go to the record's <span class="CButton">Item Activity</span> section and use <span class="CButton">Receive</span> or <span class="CButton">Receive (with PO)</span> to record the materials you bought.

<br /><br />For more on storage assignment records, see <a href="StoreroomAssignments.htm">Storeroom Assignments</a>.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton"><img src="Delete.png" alt="Delete" /></span>: Deletes the record that's currently selected. You cannot delete demands if they've already been actualized (in whole or in part).</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span>: Searches for a particular record.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Inside</span> subsection: Lists demands and actual uses of inside labor.</p>

<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">New PO Line</span>: Is enabled when an hourly outside or per job outside demand is selected in the list of demands. Clicking <span class="CButton">New PO Line</span> adds a line for the selected demand in a purchase order associated with the current work order.

<br /><br />For example, suppose you want to hire an outside plumber for a job. First, create a demand for the plumber's services (e.g. an hourly outside demand). Then select this demand and click <span class="CButton">New PO Line</span>. The resulting window asks you to specify a purchase order; you can either select one that's already associated with this work order, or you can create a new one.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Actualize</span>: Opens a new window where you can create an actual labor usage entry from an existing demand.

<br /><br />If a demand has a purchase order line associated with it, click the purchase order line and then click <span class="CButton">Actualize</span>. Otherwise, click the demand and then click <span class="CButton">Actualize</span>.

<br /><br />Typically, actual labor usage records are created <span class="Emphasis">after</span> a job is completed (when actual labor usage is known). For more about actual outside labor usages, see <a href="Edit.Actual%20Hourly%20Outside%20(no%20PO).htm">Actual Hourly Outside</a> or <a href="Edit.Actual%20Per%20Job%20Outside%20(no%20PO).htm">Actual Per Job Outside</a> (if there is no associated purchase order entry) and <a href="Edit.Actual%20Hourly%20Outside%20(with%20PO).htm">Actual Hourly Outside (with PO)</a> or <a href="Edit.Actual%20Per%20Job%20Outside%20(with%20PO).htm">Actual Per Job Outside (with PO)</a> (if there is an associated purchase order entry).</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Edit</span>: Lets you edit an existing demand in the list.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">View</span>: Lets you view an entry in the list (without changing any information in the entry).</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Temporary Storage</span> section: Lets you associate temporary storage locations with this work order. Temporary storage may be used to hold some or all of the work order's materials. This allows for situations where spare parts and other materials are transferred from their usual storerooms to some more convenient place so they'll be accessible for use on a work order. When you're working on a unit, the best temporary storage location is often the unit itself, indicating that items have been transferred to the unit's location.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">New Temporary Storage</span>: Associates a temporary storage location with this work order. For more, see <a href="Edit.Temporary%20Storage.htm">Temporary Storage Locations</a>.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">New Temporary Storage Assignment</span>: Specifies an item that should be placed in a temporary storage location. Note that you must specify the temporary storage location (using <span class="CButton">New Temporary Storage</span>) before you can assign items to that location. For more on temporary storage assignments, see <a href="Edit.Temporary%20Storage%20Assignment.htm">Temporary Storage Assignments</a>.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">New Demand Item</span>: Is enabled when you select an entry for an item in the list above the <span class="CButton">New Demand Item</span> button. Clicking this button immediately opens a window where you can create a demand for the selected item. This is exactly like clicking <span class="CButton">New Demand Item</span> in the <span class="CButton">Resources</span> section of the record; you can just save a little time and effort because you've already specified which item you want to demand.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Edit</span>: Opens a window where you can correct the selected entry (either a temporary storage location or a temporary storage assignment).</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">View</span>: Opens a window where you can look at the selected entry (but not change it).</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton"><img src="Delete.png" alt="Delete" /></span>: Deletes the entry that's currently selected. You cannot delete entries that are still in use; in particular, you can't delete an entry for a temporary storage location if there are temporary storage assignments for that location. Delete the temporary storage assignments first, then delete the temporary storage location.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span>: Searches for a particular record.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Meters</span> section: Provides information about any meters associated with the unit covered by the work order. It also lets workers record any meter readings taken during the course of this job. For more about meters, see <a href="Meters.htm">Meters</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">New Work Order Meter Reading</span>: Opens a window where you can create a new meter reading associated with this unit. The new record is initialized with default values or blanks. For more, see <a href="Edit.Work%20Order%20Meter%20Reading.htm">Work Order Meter Readings</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">View</span>: Opens a window displaying the selected meter record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Restore</span>: Restores a deleted record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Delete.png" alt="Delete" /></span>: Deletes the selected meter record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span>: Searches for a particular record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Purchase Orders</span> section: Lets you associate one or more purchase orders with this job. For example, you might create a purchase order to cover the cost of outside labor expenses if the work will be done by an outside contractor.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">New Work Order Purchase Order</span>: Opens a window where you can specify an existing purchase order that you wish to associate with this work order. For more, see <a href="Edit.Work%20Order%20Purchase%20Order.htm">Associating Work Orders with Purchase Orders</a>.</p>

<br /><br />Some work orders may have no associated requests, while the rest usually only have one request. However, it's possible for a single work order to address multiple requests; for example, several people might submit complaints about the same problem. To indicate that a request is related to an existing work order, use the <span class="CButton">Link Work Orders</span> button in the <span class="CPanel">Requests</span> viewer.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">New Requested Work Order</span>: Adds a new request to the list.</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Printed Form</span> section [only appears when editing defaults]: Specifies information that will be used when printing work orders.</p>
<p class="box"><span class="CInset">Note:</span> If you change the text in the <span class="CButton">Printed Form</span> section, it does <span class="Emphasis">not</span> change the text in any customizations you have saved previously. Customizations save their own copies of the <span class="CButton">Printed Form</span> information, and these copies are independent of any changes you make later in the main defaults. This can be confusing&#8212;when you use a customization, you will not see your new text, but rather the old text that was active when the customization was saved.</p>

<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Additional Labor/Material Lines</span>: A number. MainBoss will add this number of blank lines after the labor/material line items. For example, if you specify the number <span class="CU">6</span>, MainBoss will add six blank lines after the labor/material line items, leaving space for people to write in any useful information (e.g. the actual time the job took, and any materials that were used but not specified in the original demands).</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Additional Information</span>: Zero or more lines of text that should appear at the end of the work order. For example, you might use this to indicate where an authorization signature goes, as well as other standard information.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="PrintHS.png" alt="Print" /></span>: Opens a window for printing this work order. You can use this window to specify default option settings for printing single work orders.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the work order. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Print &amp; Close</span>: Closes the work order editor window and immediately prints the current work order. When MainBoss prints the work order, it will use any default option settings that you've specified using the <span class="CButton"><img src="PrintHS.png" alt="Print" /></span> window (above).</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the work order and sets up the window for you to create a new work order. Fields in the new work order will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current work order and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi">State change actions: A drop-down button which offers a list of actions that can be used to change the state of the work order. The current state of the work order determines which actions are enabled; it also determines which action is displayed as the label for the button. The available options are:</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Open</span>: Changes a draft work order into an open one. Opening a work order suggests that the work order contains all the information you need before starting the job and is ready to be issued to workers.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Open Work Order (With Comment)</span>: Same as <span class="CButton">Open</span>, except that MainBoss will also open a window where you can record a comment about what you're doing.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Close Work Order</span>: Changes an open work order into a closed one. Closing a work order suggests that the job is finished and you have recorded all relevant information about the work.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Close Work Order (With Comment)</span>: Same as <span class="CButton">Close Work Order</span>, except that MainBoss will also open a window where you can record a comment about what you're doing.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Reopen</span>: Changes a closed work order back into an open one. You might do this if you need to correct some information on the work order. MainBoss opens a window where you may record a comment explaining why you're reopening the work order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Suspend</span>: Changes an open work order into a draft one. You might do this if you find that you need to make significant changes to the work order. MainBoss opens a window where you may record a comment explaining why you're suspending the work order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Void</span>: Changes a draft work order into a void one. This means canceling the job. MainBoss opens a window where you may record a comment explaining why you're canceling the work order.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Re-Draft</span>: Changes a void work order into a draft one. This means reactivating a canceled job. MainBoss opens a window where you may record a comment explaining why you're reactivating the work order.</p>
<p class="box">If you have specified the appropriate request transition options, closing a work order automatically closes each linked request, provided that each request only has one linked work order. For more on this option, see <a href="Edit.Work%20Order%20Request%20Transition.htm">Specifying Request State Transitions</a>.</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Add Work Order Comment</span>: Adds a comment to the selected work order. The comment is recorded in a state history record. For more, see <a href="Edit.Work%20Order%20State%20History.htm">Editing Work Order State History Records</a>.</p>
