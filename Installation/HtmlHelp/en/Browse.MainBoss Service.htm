<p>You control the operation of MainBoss Service using <span class="CPanel">Administration</span> | <span class="CPanel">MainBoss Service</span>. This displays the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Service Name</span>: The name of the MainBoss Service service. This is typically "<span class="CU">MainBossService</span>" but may be longer if you have multiple copies running on your computer (in order to handle multiple MainBoss databases).</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Service Machine Name</span>: The name of the computer where the service is running.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Service Account Name</span>: The login name or Windows account under which the service is running. By default, this is <span class="CU">NT AUTHORITY\Network Service</span>, a Windows account often used for running services.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">SQL Userid</span> The SQL Server authentication credential the service is using.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Status</span>: The current status of MainBoss Service on your system. Possibilities are:</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CU">NotInstalled</span>: MainBoss Service hasn't yet been installed on any system.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CU">Stopped</span>: MainBoss Service isn't running.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CU">Running</span>: MainBoss Service is active.</p>
<p class="wi">Event Log: Diagnostic messages that have been generated in connection with MainBoss Service. To read the details of any message in the list, click the message. The details will be displayed in the <span class="CButton">Details</span> area below the Event Log.</p>
<p class="box">If you do not have Windows Administrator privileges on the computer where MainBoss Service is installed, or if there is some other reason why the event log can't be displayed, MainBoss shows a diagnostic message in place of the event log. For further information, see the Installation and Administration Guide.</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Apply Filter</span>: Lets you set up a <span class="NewTerm">filter</span> to select which records should be shown in the table. For more information, see <a href="Filter.htm">Table Filters</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span>: Lets you search through the event log. For more information, see <a href="Search.htm">Searching for a Particular Record</a>. The <span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span> button has an accompanying drop-down list containing the following:</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Find Next</span>: Uses the same search condition(s) as your most recent search and finds the next record in the table that matches the condition(s). If the search reaches the end of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the start of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Find Previous</span>: Same as <span class="CButton">Find Next</span> except that it goes backward in the table. If the search reaches the start of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the end of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Start Service</span>/<span class="CButton">Restart Service</span>/<span class="CButton">Stop Service</span>: Starts, restarts or stops the service. You must have Windows Administration privileges in order to perform these operations. (Restarting the service means stopping it, then starting it again.)</p>
<p class="box"><span class="CInset">Note:</span> In order to use <span class="CButton">Start Service</span> and <span class="CButton">Stop Service</span>, you need Windows Administrator privileges. For <span class="CButton">Pause Service</span> and <span class="CButton">Resume Service</span> (described below), you only need the MainBoss <span class="CU">Administration</span> security role.

<br /><br />On the other hand, if you're running a demonstration version of MainBoss, MainBoss Service will only run for 60 minutes before terminating. In this case, you <span class="Emphasis">must</span> use <span class="CButton">Start Service</span> to restart the service, and you must have Windows Administrator privileges.</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Configure Windows Service for MainBoss</span>: Installs a Windows Service for MainBoss on the current computer, and configures the service using your current configuration. Before you do this, you should test the configuration first, as described in <a href="TheMainBossServiceModule.htm">The MainBoss Service Module</a>.

<br /><br />This button has a drop-down list containing:</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Delete Windows Service for MainBoss</span>: Deletes (uninstalls) the Windows Service for MainBoss associated with the current database.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Process Email</span>: Runs the MainBoss Service software for a single processing cycle. This does not install the software as a Windows service; it simply does a single run using the current configuration. This lets you manually run the service without needing to install it as a Windows Service.  This operation will be unavailable if the Windows Service for MainBoss is running.

<br /><br />You do not need Windows Administrator privilege to process MainBoss service requests manually.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Process Email with Diagnostics</span>: Does the same thing as <span class="CButton">Process Email</span>, but also finds any diagnostic messages that may have been generated by MainBoss Service. Diagnostic messages (if any) will appear in the blank area of the window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Refresh Service</span>: Sends your current configuration to an installed version of MainBoss Service. You should perform this action whenever you change your MainBoss Service configuration.

<br /><br />This button has a drop-down list containing:</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Pause Service</span>: Temporarily suspends MainBoss Service. The software will not process any requests, acknowledgements or notifications while it is suspended.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Resume Service</span>: Activates MainBoss Service after it has been suspended by <span class="CButton">Pause Service</span>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Notify Service</span>: Notifies the Windows Service for MainBoss to begin an unscheduled processing cycle for all MainBoss service operations. This supersedes the usual schedule.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Delete Activity Logging Entries</span>: Helps you clean up the files that contain log messages created by MainBoss Service. In particular, it deletes messages that arise from erroneous or unexpected conditions that arise during processing.

<br /><br />This button has a drop-down list containing:</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Delete Trace Logging Entries</span>: Helps you clean up the files that contain log messages created by MainBoss Service. In particular, it deletes messages that mark various stages in MainBoss Service's processing cycle (e.g. when it starts to process requestor acknowledgements).</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Delete All Logging Entries</span>: Deletes all current entries in the files that contain log messages created by MainBoss Service.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Stop All Tracing</span>: Tells MainBoss Service not to produce trace log messages.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Trace All</span>: Tells MainBoss Service to trace all stages in the processing cycle. This includes <span class="CButton">Trace Email Requests</span>, <span class="CButton">Trace Notify Requestor</span>, and <span class="CButton">Trace Notify Assignee</span>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Trace Email Requests</span>: Tells MainBoss Service to trace the processing of requests sent in by email.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Trace Notify Requestor</span>: Tells MainBoss Service to trace the processing of notifications sent to requestors.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Trace Notify Assignee</span>: Tells MainBoss Service to trace the processing of notifications sent to assignees of requests, work orders, and purchase orders.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the window to reflect any recent additions to the logging entries.</p>
