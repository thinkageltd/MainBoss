<p>The Total Work Order Duration by Grouping report provides one or more charts showing the total duration of groups of work orders. The options you specify in the <span class="CButton">Grouping</span> section of the report window will dictate what charts actually appear in the report.</p>

<p>The total duration is based on MainBoss's best guess at the actual duration of each work order involved. The actual duration is calculated as follows:</p>

<ol><li>If a work order has been closed or voided at least once, then the actual duration is the actual end date minus the date the work order was first opened. (For the definition of actual end date, see <a href="Report.Work Order Count by Ended Date.htm">Work Order Count by Ended Date Chart</a>.)</li>
<li>If the work order has never been closed or voided, MainBoss will assume the actual duration of the work order will be the "<span class="CField">Duration</span>" value stated in the work order itself (i.e. the estimated duration calculated from "<span class="CField">Work End Date</span>" minus "<span class="CField">Work Start Date</span>").
</li></ol><p>You obtain the report with <span class="CPanel">Work Orders</span> | <span class="CPanel">Charts</span> | <span class="CPanel">Total Work Order Duration by Grouping</span>. The resulting window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Grouping</span> section: Options controlling what charts actually appear in the report. You must specify at least one grouping option to have any charts appear.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Sorting</span> section: Options controlling how the bars are sorted within bar-chart.</p>
<p class="box">For more on how to use <span class="CButton">Grouping</span> and <span class="CButton">Sorting</span>, see <a href="ReportSections.htm">Report Sections</a>.</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Filters</span> section: Options controlling which work orders will be included in the report. For more information, see <a href="ReportFilter.htm">Report Filters</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Include Inactive records</span>: If this checkbox is checkmarked, all relevant records will be included in the report, no matter how old they are. If this checkbox is blank, only active records will be included; this means that old "inactive" records will be ignored.

<br /><br />For more about the active filter, see <a href="Edit.Active Filter.htm">The Active Filter</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Field Selection</span> section: Options controlling which information fields will be included in the report.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Suppress Costs</span>: Omits any money information that might otherwise be displayed in the report.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Advanced</span> section: Miscellaneous options.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Format Report in Columns</span>: If this checkbox is checkmarked, the chart will have information formatted in columns; this has the advantage of compressing a lot of information into a small amount of space, but may be difficult to read, especially if you ask for many pieces of information to be displayed. If the checkbox is blank, information will be laid out in a less rigid format.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Summary Format</span>: If this checkbox is checkmarked, the chart is just a summary. You don't see information on individual work orders; instead, you get a summary of all work orders in a particular group, as dictated by the options specified in the <span class="CButton">Grouping</span> section. For example, if you are grouping by <span class="CButton">Work Category</span>, you will get a summary for each category.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Report width in pages</span>: Makes it possible to have lines that are wider than a single page. This is particularly useful when you are previewing reports on a monitor screen. For further information, see <a href="ReportSections.htm">Report Sections</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Title</span>: The title to be printed at the beginning of the report.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Main Font</span>: The font that will be used for most of the characters in the report. This should be a font that is supported by both your Windows system and your printer.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Fixed-width Font</span>: The font that will be used for information that is printed with fixed-width characters (mostly unit specifications). This should be a font that is supported by both your Windows system and your printer.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Chart Axis Interval</span>: Specifies the units for measuring work order duration. For example, if you specify <span class="CButton">Days</span>, the charts will show how many days each work order took.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Show Summary charts for each group</span>: If this box is checkmarked, the output will include summaries for each group. For example, if the report is grouped by unit, then there'll be summary information for each unit.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Show Summary charts for the report</span>: If this box is checkmarked, the output will have a summary covering all the information in the report.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Preview</span> section: Displays a visual preview of the report. If you click the <span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span> button, you automatically go to this section.

<br /><br />The <span class="CButton">Preview</span> section contains buttons for looking through the report preview and for actually printing the information. For more on using the <span class="CButton">Preview</span> section, see <a href="ReportButtons.htm">Report Buttons</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="PrintHS.png" alt="Print" /></span>: Immediately prints the report.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Export Data</span>: Exports the report's data in XML format.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Cancels the preparation and printing of a report. This button is enabled only when MainBoss is preparing a report, i.e. gathering the data and formatting it. For more information, see <a href="ReportButtons.htm">Report Buttons</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Clicking this button generates a preview of the report, displayed in the <span class="CButton">Preview</span> section of the window.</p>
