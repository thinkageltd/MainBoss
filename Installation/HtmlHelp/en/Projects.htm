<p>Sometimes a number of separate work orders are all related to the same overall project. For example, suppose you're doing a significant renovation on your headquarters; the renovation might result in a large number or work orders for various aspects of the job.</p>

<p>When you create a work order you can specify that it's part of a particular <span class="NewTerm">project</span>. For example, you can create a project named <span class="CU">HQ Renovation</span> and mark all work orders that are part of the renovation. This makes it possible for you to obtain reports about each project, thereby tracking the time and resources that the project uses.</p>

<p>Note the distinction between projects and work categories; a project covers a specific set of related jobs, while a work category deals with a general type of job. For example, you might have a work category named <span class="CU">Renovation</span> which deals with renovations anywhere, as well as a project named <span class="CU">HQ Renovation</span> which deals with a specific set of renovation jobs in your headquarters.</p>

<p>Purchase orders can also be associated with projects. This makes it easier to associate particular materials for projects, even if you don't yet have specific work orders that use those materials.</p>
