<p>The employees table is a list of your employees. When you want to add someone to your employee list, you must create a contact record for that person first (specifying contact information for the person). Then you create an employee record that refers to the contact record. For more on contacts, see <a href="Contacts.htm">Contacts</a>.</p>

<p>Employee records typically have one or more associated <span class="NewTerm">hourly inside</span> records. An hourly inside record tells the hourly rate for the employee on a particular type of job. Often, an employee will only have one associated hourly rate record ("Pat is a licensed electrician, and we pay all our licensed electricians $X an hour"). However, some employees may have multiple records ("When Pat works on electrician jobs we pay $X an hour, but for other types of jobs we pay $Y an hour"). For more on hourly inside records, see <a href="HourlyInside.htm">Hourly Inside</a>.</p>
