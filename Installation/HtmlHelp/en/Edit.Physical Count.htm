<p>Most organizations occasionally take inventory, to make sure that computer records match what's actually in each storeroom. If there's a difference between the expected quantity of an item and the actual quantity on hand, you use a <span class="NewTerm">physical count</span> record to state the actual quantity.</p>

<p>To record a physical count, go to <span class="CPanel">Items</span> | <span class="CPanel">Storeroom Assignments</span> or <span class="CPanel">Coding Definitions</span> | <span class="CPanel">Items</span> | <span class="CPanel">Storeroom Assignments</span> and click on the record for the storeroom and item whose count you want to record. Click <span class="CButton">Edit</span> to open the code's record. Then, in the record's <span class="CButton">Item Activity</span> section, click <span class="CButton">New Physical Count</span>. This opens a window where you can record the results of your physical count. The window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Entry Date</span>: A read-only field giving the date that this record was created.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Effective Date</span>: The effective date when the physical count took place. By default, this is set to the current date and time, but you can set it to some other date/time.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">User Contact</span>: A read-only field giving your user name. This will appear in MainBoss's accounting history to show who recorded the physical count.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Storage Assignment</span>: A storeroom assignment record indicating the item and storeroom where the count was taken. For more on storeroom assignment records, see <a href="StoreroomAssignments.htm">Storeroom Assignments</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Adjustment Code</span>: A read-only field identifying the adjustment code used for this physical count. For more on adjustment codes, see <a href="ItemAdjustmentCodes.htm">Item Adjustment Codes</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Voiding Void Physical Count Entry Date</span>: A read-only field giving the date on which this physical count was voided, if applicable.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Voiding Void Physical Count</span>: A read-only field giving the void code used to void this physical count record, if applicable.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Quantity</span>: The new quantity on hand in the storeroom, as determined by the physical count.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Item Pricing and Purchasing History</span>: This area lets you specify a pricing record for the item you want to purchase. Pricing records may be price quotes or actual prices paid in the past. (For more on price quotes, see <a href="Edit.Item%20Pricing.htm">Item Pricing</a>.)

<br /><br />At the bottom of this area is a drop-down list which will display storage assignments based on the options specified in the "<span class="CField">Item Location</span>" area. By choosing appropriate options, you can reduce the entries that are shown in the drop-down list, making it quicker and easier to choose the one you want. The possible options are:</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Do not include Purchasing History</span>: If you checkmark this box, the drop-down list will only contain price quotes. If you leave the checkbox blank, the drop-down list will also contain actual prices paid to vendors in the past.</p>
<p class="wi2">Drop-down list: The drop-down list at the end of the "<span class="CField">Item Pricing and Purchasing History</span>" area shows pricing records that satisfy the options you have specified.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">On Hand</span>: Read-only fields giving the quantity expected in the given storeroom and the price for that quantity.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Pricing Basis</span>: Read-only fields giving pricing information from the record selected in "<span class="CField">Item Pricing and Purchase History</span>".</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Calculated Item Price Cost</span>: A read-only field giving the unit cost and total cost of new quantity on hand, as calculated from existing MainBoss pricing information.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Use calculated item price cost</span>: If this box is checkmarked, MainBoss will use "<span class="CField">Calculated Cost</span>" as the actual cost of the given "<span class="CField">Quantity</span>". If you want to use some other cost, leave the box blank and fill in "<span class="CField">Cost</span>".</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Cost</span>: The cost of the given "<span class="CField">Quantity</span>". You can fill in the "<span class="CField">Unit Cost</span>" column (the cost of a single unit of the item) or the "<span class="CField">Total Cost</span>" (the total cost of the adjustment). Whichever column you fill in, MainBoss automatically fills in the other column. If you checkmark <span class="CButton">Use calculated item price cost</span>, MainBoss automatically fills in both columns.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">From Cost Center</span>, <span class="CField">To Cost Center</span>: Read-only fields telling the cost centers involved in this operation. MainBoss creates accounting records indicating the transfer of money from the first cost center to the second. These fields are only visible if your database has an <span class="BL">Accounting</span> license key. For more, see <a href="AccountingFacilities.htm">Accounting Facilities</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
