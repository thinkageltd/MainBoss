<p>Request status codes give you a way to indicate when a request needs someone's attention. For example, some maintenance departments have a policy of verifying certain types of problem reports before actually doing something about them. You might create a status <span class="CU">Waiting for confirmation</span> to mark a request which has been received from a client but which has not been verified by maintenance personnel. As another example, you might use requests to keep track of "wish-list" jobs: work you might do someday, but not in the immediate future. In this case, you might create a status <span class="CU">Long-Term</span> to mark requests that you want to remember but that you won't deal with anytime soon.</p>

<p class="box">While it is possible to use status codes for any purpose, we recommend that you only use them for requests that are notable in some way. "Normal" requests should have their "<span class="CField">Status</span>" field blank.</p>

<p>You assign a status code to a request by clicking the <span class="CButton">New Requestor Comment</span> button, or some other button that lets you create a request history record. The request state history window lets you set or change the status of a request.</p>

<p>The status codes for work requests may be different from the status codes used for work orders and purchase orders.</p>
