<p>The material forecast report predicts the items that MainBoss expects will be used in a specified period of time. MainBoss assumes that all materials for a job are needed on the date given by "<span class="CField">Work Start Date</span>". You obtain a material forecast report with <span class="CPanel">Unit Maintenance Plans</span> | <span class="CPanel">Reports</span> | <span class="CPanel">Material Forecast</span>.</p>

<p>The report is created by obtaining information from all work orders whose "<span class="CField">Work Start Date</span>" falls within the given period. For example, suppose you ask for a report covering the week starting next Monday. Then the report will cover all work orders whose "<span class="CField">Work Start Date</span>" falls within the given week, including any preventive maintenance work orders that might be generated for that week.</p>

<p>Note that the report does <span class="Emphasis">not</span> include any ongoing work orders that begin <span class="Emphasis">before</span> the given period. For example, if you ask for a report covering the week starting next Monday, the report will not include materials on work orders that start before that Monday.</p>

<p class="box"><span class="CInset">Note:</span> In order to create this report, MainBoss must do the same amount of work that's required to generate preventive maintenance work orders. This can take a great deal of time, especially if you have a lot of unit maintenance plans.</p>

By default, the report covers the forthcoming week, starting today and ending a week from today. To change the report's period, set the "<span class="CField">From Date</span>" and "<span class="CField">To Date</span>" values in the <span class="CButton">Filters</span> section of the report window.

<p>The report window contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Grouping</span> section: Options controlling how the report is broken into sections and sub-sections.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Show summary footer for the overall report</span>: If this box is checkmarked, the report will include a final line summarizing information from the entire report. If the box is blank, no such line will be included.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Sorting</span> section: Options controlling how records are sorted within each section and sub-section.</p>
<p class="box">For more on how to use <span class="CButton">Grouping</span> and <span class="CButton">Sorting</span>, see <a href="ReportSections.htm">Report Sections</a>.</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Filters</span> section: Options controlling what kind of information will be included in the report. For more information, see <a href="ReportFilter.htm">Report Filters</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Include Resources for existing Work Orders</span>: If this box is checkmarked, the report will include information about resources on existing work orders as well as on preventive maintenance work orders that might be generated. If the box is blank, the report will only include information about preventive maintenance work orders that might be generated for the given period.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">PM Generation Filters</span>: Make selections based on the date of PM generation. For example, you can restrict the print-out to PM work orders generated between a certain set of dates.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Field Selection</span> section: Options controlling which information fields will be included in the report.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Suppress Costs</span>: Omits any money information that might otherwise be displayed in the report.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Advanced</span> section: Miscellaneous options.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Format Report in Columns</span>: If this checkbox is checkmarked, the report will have information formatted in columns; this has the advantage of compressing a lot of information into a small amount of space, but may be difficult to read, especially if you ask for many pieces of information to be displayed. If the checkbox is blank, information will be laid out in a less rigid format.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">Summary Format</span>: If this checkbox is checkmarked, the report is just a summary. You don't see information on individual materials; instead, you get a summary of all materials in a particular group, as dictated by the options specified in the <span class="CButton">Grouping</span> section. For example, if you are grouping by <span class="CButton">Item Category</span>, you will get a summary for each category.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Report width in pages</span>: Makes it possible to have lines that are wider than a single page. This is particularly useful when you are previewing reports on a monitor screen. For further information, see <a href="ReportSections.htm">Report Sections</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Title</span>: The title to be printed at the beginning of the report.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Main Font</span>: The font that will be used for most of the characters in the report. This should be a font that is supported by both your Windows system and your printer.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Fixed-width Font</span>: The font that will be used for information that is printed with fixed-width characters (mostly unit specifications). This should be a font that is supported by both your Windows system and your printer.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Preview</span> section: Displays a visual preview of the report. If you click the <span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span> button, you automatically go to this section.

<br /><br />The <span class="CButton">Preview</span> section contains buttons for looking through the report preview and for actually printing the information. For more on using the <span class="CButton">Preview</span> section, see <a href="ReportButtons.htm">Report Buttons</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="PrintHS.png" alt="Print" /></span>: Immediately prints the report.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Export Data</span>: Exports the report's data in XML format.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Cancels the preparation and printing of a report. This button is enabled only when MainBoss is preparing a report, i.e. gathering the data and formatting it. For more information, see <a href="ReportButtons.htm">Report Buttons</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Clicking this button generates a preview of the report, displayed in the <span class="CButton">Preview</span> section of the window.</p>
