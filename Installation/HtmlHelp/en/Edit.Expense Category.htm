<p>You create or modify expense categories by clicking <span class="CButton">New Expense Category</span> or <span class="CButton">Edit</span> in the <span class="CButton">View</span> section of <span class="CPanel">Coding Definitions</span> | <span class="CPanel">Work Orders</span> | <span class="CPanel">Expense Categories</span>. For an overview of expense categories and MainBoss accounting in general, see <a href="AccountingFacilities.htm">Accounting Facilities</a>.</p>

<p>The expense category editor contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Code</span>: A brief code to identify this record. No two records may have the same code.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Description</span>: A longer description of the expense category.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CField">Comments</span>: Any comments you want to associate with the category.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Valid for Items</span>: If this box is checkmarked, this expense category may be used for entries in the <span class="CButton">Items</span> subsection of a work order's <span class="CButton">Resources</span> section. If the box is blank, the expense category may not be used for items.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Filter for Hourly Inside, Hourly Outside, Per Job Inside, Per Job Outside</span>: If this box is checkmarked, this expense category may be used for entries in the <span class="CButton">Inside</span> and <span class="CButton">Outside</span> subsections of a work order's <span class="CButton">Resources</span> section. If the box is blank, the expense category may not be used for such labor expenses.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Valid for Miscellaneous Costs</span>: If this box is checkmarked, this expense category may be used for entries in the <span class="CButton">Miscellaneous Expenses</span> subsection of a work order's <span class="CButton">Resources</span> section. If the box is blank, the expense category may not be used for miscellaneous expenses.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Expense Mappings</span> section: Lists any expense models that allow this expense category. For more on expense mappings, see <a href="Edit.Expense%20Mapping.htm">Expense Mappings</a>.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
