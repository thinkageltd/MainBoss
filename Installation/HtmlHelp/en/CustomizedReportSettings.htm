<p>You can create customized report settings in exactly the same way that you create customized table settings (see <a href="CustomizedTableSettings.htm">Customized Table Settings</a>). For example, if you regularly want a report of work orders performed in Plant #2, you could set up the options you want and then save them under a name like <span class="CU">Plant</span> <span class="CU">#2</span> <span class="CU">Work</span> <span class="CU">Orders</span>. Any time you want the report, you can simply select the name from the list of available settings; MainBoss will then adjust all the options so that you'll see the report when you click the report window's refresh button (<span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>).</p>

<p class="box"><span class="CInset">Note:</span> Generating reports can take a lot of time, especially if the report contains a lot of data. Therefore, when you select a name from the list of available settings, MainBoss doesn't immediately generate the corresponding report. This may be a little confusing, but it's actually practical&#8212;if you accidentally pick the wrong entry from the list of available settings, you don't want MainBoss pausing for a long time while it generates a report that you don't actually want. When you select a customized report from the list, MainBoss doesn't generate the report until you click <span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>.</p>

<p>Some report windows may seem the same as others, but aren't. For example, if you click <span class="CButton"><img src="PrintHS.png" alt="Print" /></span> in the window for editing a work order, the resulting report window is not the same as other windows for printing work order reports. As a result, it doesn't have the same list of available settings. This can be confusing&#8212;you might expect to see your favorite "Print Work Order" settings available no matter what report window you use. The explanation is simply that the report windows may look the same, but they aren't.</p>
