<p>You create or modify unit-to-unit relationship records by clicking <span class="CButton">New Unit Unit Relationship</span> or <span class="CButton">Edit</span> in the <span class="CButton">View</span> section of <span class="CPanel">Coding Definitions</span> | <span class="CPanel">Relationships</span>.</p>

<p>When you create a relationship record, you specify two English phrases for what the relationship means. For example, here is a relationship that can be used between a room (the first unit) and a heater (the second unit).</p>

<ul class="b1"><li>The room <span class="BL">is heated by</span> the heater</li>
<li>The heater <span class="BL">heats</span> the room
</li></ul><p>When you create a relationship, we strongly recommend that you test it out immediately to make sure you have the two phrases in the right order.</p>

<p>The editor for creating unit-to-unit relationship records contains the following:</p>

<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Details</span> section: Basic information about the relationship.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Code</span>: An identification code for this relationship.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Description</span>: A more detailed description of the relationship.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">B As Related to A Phrase</span>: A phrase describing the second unit's connection with the first. In our example above, this would be <span class="CU">heats</span>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">A As Related to B Phrase</span>: A phrase describing the first unit's connection with the second. In our example above, this would be <span class="CU">is heated by</span>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CField">Comments</span>: Any comments you want to associate with this relationship.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Unit Related Units</span> section: Lists pairs of units that make use of this relationship.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">A Unit Location</span>: This column lists the "first units" that use this relationship.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">B Unit Location</span>: This column lists the second units that correspond to the first units.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton">New Unit Related Unit</span>: Opens a window that lets you specify a relationship between two units. For more information, see <a href="Edit.Unit Related Unit.htm">Unit-to-Unit Relationships</a>.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Edit.png" alt="Edit" /></span>: This drop-down button offers several possible actions:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Edit</span>: Opens an editor window to let you edit the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">View</span>: Opens an editor window where you can examine the selected record.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Delete.png" alt="Delete" /></span>: Deletes the record that's currently selected.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span>: Lets you search through the list of records for a particular record. For more information, see <a href="Search.htm">Searching for a Particular Record</a>. The <span class="CButton"><img src="Find_VS.png" alt="Search" /></span> button has an accompanying drop-down list containing the following:</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Find Next</span>: Uses the same search condition(s) as your most recent search and finds the next record in the table that matches the condition(s). If the search reaches the end of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the start of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi3"><span class="CButton">Find Previous</span>: Same as <span class="CButton">Find Next</span> except that it goes backward in the table. If the search reaches the start of the table without finding a matching record, it goes to the end of the table and continues the search.</p>
<p class="wi2"><span class="CButton"><img src="Refresh.png" alt="Refresh" /></span>: Updates the list to reflect any recent changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; New</span>: Saves the current record and sets up the window for you to enter a new record. Fields in the new record will be blank or set to default values.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save</span>: Saves the current record. The editor window stays open in case you want to make more changes to the same record.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Save &amp; Close</span>: Saves the current record and closes the editor window.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Cancel</span>: Closes the window without saving any changes you've made to the record since the last time you saved. When you <span class="CButton">Save</span> the record, the <span class="CButton">Cancel</span> button changes to <span class="CButton">Close</span>, indicating that you can safely close the window without losing any changes.</p>
<p class="wi"><span class="CButton">Close</span>: Closes the window. This button only appears after you've saved changes with <span class="CButton">Save</span> or before you've entered any data at all. Otherwise, the button is labeled <span class="CButton">Cancel</span>.</p>
