When setting up MainBossWebAccess on GEHIRN, accessing the SQL Server on mozek:

Initially, after creating a 'MainBossWebAccess' application in the DefaultWebSite on GEHIRN, with the virtual directory set to 'C:\inetpub\wwwroot\mainbossremote'
IIS was configured to
a) Disable Anonymous Authentication
b) Enable Windows Authentication
c) Disabled ASP.NET Impersonation (default)

The application files were copied to the directory (published from VS) on \\GEHIRN\C$\inetput\wwwroot\mainbossremote and the Application Settings for the
IIS application modified to add 'dbname = ThinkageMainBossErrorTracking' and 'dbserver = mozek.thoughts.thinkage.ca'

On first access to http://gehirn/mainbossremote, the error received was
Server Error in '/MainBossWebAccess' Application. Login failed for user 'THOUGHTS\GEHIRN$'. 

To permit access from GEHIRN to MOZEK's SQL server, I had to:

1) Create a domain account called IIS_GEHIRNSQL
2) Configure MOZEK's SQL Logins to allow IIS_GEHIRNSQL to login
3) Configure the MainBoss Database (ThinkageMainBossErrorTracking) to have IIS_GEHIRNSQL as a user of the database, and placed it in the 'MainBoss Role'
(no need to add it to the Users table in MainBoss, but it DOES require access to the database as far as SQL is concerned)
4) Change ASP.NET impersonation from disabled to enabled and to a specific User (THOUGHTS\IIS_GEHIRNSQL). This also required entering the password (which will
end up in PLAIN text in the web.config file !) See http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;329290
for (old) information on how to fix this.

On Next access after the above changes, the error received was:
'Could not load file or assembly 'System.Web.Mvc' or one of its dependencies. Access is denied. '

This was fixed by adding THOUGHTS\IIS_GEHIRNSQL with read/write file system privileges to the directory %SystemRoot%\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\versionNumber\Temporary ASP.NET Files.
Note that on a non X64 system, the Framework is simply %SystemRoot%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\versionNumber\Temporary ASP.NET Files
This was gleaned from http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/kwzs111e.aspx (ASP.NET Required Access Control Lists (ACLs))

Next, I got 'No licenses found for the application 'MainBoss Web'; 
this requires putting the MainBossWeb license into the MainBoss database.

Next, I managed to get the FIRST (Home) page loaded, but nothing else; All results were HTTP Error 404.
IIS on GEHIRN was running in CLASSIC mode! A note in the MVC global.asax file referred me to 	// visit http://go.microsoft.com/?LinkId=9394801

I choose to configure my OWN application pool called MainBossWeb, running in Integrated mode, and switched the installed
MainBossWebAccess to that pool.
