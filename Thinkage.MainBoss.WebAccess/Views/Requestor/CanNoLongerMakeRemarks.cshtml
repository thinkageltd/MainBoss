        The following does not work any longer as some browsers do not honor self.close on windows that were not opened with window.open(); some browser (like chome) just silently ignore it; others warn you that they are ignoring it
        In any event, we should not offer Close, but Try Again and put the user back to the input form (WITH THEIR Input DATA INTACT) with a refreshed state history context
