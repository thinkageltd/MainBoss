1) WarrantyExpiry in old Units goes into a "*WARRANTY" Service contract where the warranty expiry is the end date, and the purchase date is the start date.
   ServiceVendor in Unit becomes the Service Contract Vendor.
   ServiceContract code is constructed with 'SC_'+ unit code (as corrected for duplicates; see below)

2) Buildings go into Location table, with appropriate construction of Postal Address table. 
   Vendor addresses create a Location table entry, with a CODE of 'V_' + vendor code

3) Obsolete Units are marked Hidden on conversion; Obsolete code go into UnitUsage category table, and references made as required.

4) CreateDate on Meter becomes a 0 entry reading that predates other history of meter readings if a meter reading doesn't exist for that date/time stamp.
   MeterClasses are created from the MeterCodes and the UOM CODE for each distinct combination of MeterCode & UOM (METER.[CODE]+'_'+'UOM.[CODE])
   Null UOM codes are not allowed so MB29 Meters that had NULL UOM specified will be assigned to the special UOM code '*mb29_UOM*' created
   in the UOM table.

5) CostCenter on Units is not converted to anything; user is expected to set up WorkOrderExpenseModels for units as required.

6) UnitCategories are converted to 'E'+code and 'S'+code for the code.

7) UNIT codes now must be unique across buildings (locations). To this end, data from mb29 that used to have Equipment/Space codes the same across buildings
   will have those dupliate codes amended with numbers. Example; Unit 'Z' occuring 5 times in 5 different buildings would end up with codes
   'Z', 'Z1', 'Z12', 'Z123', 'Z1234'.  The conversion breaks if more than 20 consecutive duplications appear....
   
   
Specification conversion will insert a comment in the comment field
Data conversion stopped due to missing : at end of original specification data'
for those specifications it finds with malformed data.
