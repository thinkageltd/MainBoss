	The 2.9 Vendor does not have a C/C, but this is a required field in 3.0.
	There really isn't a good reason for requiring this in 3.0, we could just complain when a Transaction is about to be made and the vendor's
	null A/P c/c ends up in the transaction. However if the site is running without accounting, we still create transactions and a C/C must be
	present anyway (even if it were not a required field). We have to make vendors with no C/C reference the pre-build C/C provided for this purpose.
