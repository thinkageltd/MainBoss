A note about test scripts

The environment I have been using to write scripts to
'drive' MainBoss and all forms, controls, etc from
within it has been a language called AutoIT.  AutoIT
is a scripting language similar to VB and the likes.
It's available at http://www.autoitscript.com .

Research has lead me to believe that events such as
clicks, send text, etc are done through a Win32API
call to SendInput() in the user32.dll file.  This
allows for simulated input to be passed into the
message queue of any program with a handle, and even
some without.

To use the scripts uyou must first install AutoIT.  
Then open the au3 file in the SciTE editor and hit F5
as in VS.  I assumed that MainBoss would be open and
would not be minimized when the scripts were run.  You
must also have selected a maintenance organization and
be idling at the 'control panel'.
